Page 1 of 7https://www.imf.org/en/Blogs/Articles/2023/07/18/crypto-needs-comprehensive-policies-to-protect-economies-and-investorsThe global push for clearer policies on crypto assets has gained momentum underthe Indian G20 Presidency. As this work continues, it’s important to recognize theprogress already achieved, but more is needed, especially in implementing globalstandards.Last year’s failures of the FTX crypto trading platform and the TerraLuna stablecoin highlighted the urgency of establishing clear policies to protectinvestors and prevent abuse. Despite recent industry challenges, investor optimismcontinues to revive periodically, as evidenced by Bitcoin’s near doubling this year.Without robust safeguards, the increased risk of fraud and misconduct couldadversely impact investors expected returns.While some policymakers have taken necessary steps to safeguard consumers andensure financial integrity, it is equally important to consider the broaderDigitalizationEstablishing effective policies has become aEstablishing effective policies has become apriority for authorities amid the failure of somepriority for authorities amid the failure of someexchanges and collapse of certain crypto assetsexchanges and collapse of certain crypto assetsJuly 18, 2023Crypto Needs ComprehensiveCrypto Needs ComprehensivePolicies to Protect EconomiesPolicies to Protect Economiesand Investorsand Investors

Such assets, particularly stablecoins denominated in hardcurrencies, could potentially replace official currencies, and significantly impactcountries monetary and fiscal policies. This is especially true in emerging marketsand developing economies, underscoring the need for a comprehensive,consistent, and coordinated policy approach to crypto.That’s why we presented an assessment of the macro implications of crypto assetsto the G20 presidency earlier this year, building on recommendations outlined inthe Elements of Effective Policies for Crypto Assets endorsed by the IMF ExecutiveBoard in February.Our approach features three key pillars: a sound macro-policy foundation, clearlegal treatment and granular rules, and effective implementation.These are our key policy recommendations:The defense against the substitution of sovereign currencies is themaintenance of robust, trusted, and credible domestic institutions.Transparent, consistent, and coherent monetary policy frameworks arecrucial for an effective response to the challenges posed by cryptoassets.To protect national sovereignty, it is important not to grant cryptoassets official currency or legal tender status. Doing so would requireaccepting them in many jurisdictions for tax payments, fines, and debtsettlements, and could generate fiscal risks for government finances,and could threaten financial stability or rapid inflation.To address the volatility of capital flows associated with crypto,policymakers should integrate them within existing regimes and rules 1/24/24, 12:20 PMCrypto Needs Comprehensive Policies to Protect Economies and Investors

This will help ensure stability and minimizepotential disruptions.Finally, tax policies should ensure unambiguous treatment of cryptoassets, and administrators should strengthen compliance efforts.Specific regulations are needed to clarify the tax treatment of crypto,including value-added taxes or levies on income or wealth. 1/24/24, 12:20 PMCrypto Needs Comprehensive Policies to Protect Economies and Investors

Page 5 of 7https://www.imf.org/en/Blogs/Articles/2023/07/18/crypto-needs-comprehensive-policies-to-protect-economies-and-investorsConsistent with the recommendations by standard setters such as the BaselCommittee on Banking Supervision, Financial Action Task Force, Financial StabilityBoard, and the International Organization of Securities Commissions, ourrecommendations are:A comprehensive legal foundation is essential to effectively regulatecrypto, addressing both private law and financial law aspects. Thisincludes ensuring predictability and enforceability of rights whileappropriately classifying crypto.Strong anti-money laundering and combating the financing ofterrorism (AML/CFT), prudential and conduct rules should beimplemented to cover all entities and activities related to the issuance,trading, custody, or transfer of crypto.For systemic stablecoin arrangements, additional requirements such asthe Principles for Financial Market Infrastructures—standards that aimto ensure the safety, efficiency, and resilience of FMIs—should beapplied.Significantly, the FSB in July established a set of high-level recommendations forcrypto regulation, focusing on financial stability. They include ensuring authorities’regulatory powers and sound governance and risk management practices byproviders.

Authorities must have the necessary skillsand resources to oversee the evolving crypto asset landscape.Given the borderless nature of the crypto-assets ecosystem,international collaboration and information sharing are crucial.Cooperation among supervisors and competent authorities will enablethe monitoring of crypto asset service providers and maintain theefficacy of regulatory policies.Going beyond crypto polices,public authorities should take advantagein the progress in digital technology to enhance public policyobjectives and must actively collaborate to address ongoing cost, trust,and speed issues, particularly for cross-border payments. Newmultilateral platforms could improve the efficiency of transactions.The IMF will continue to support the G20 by delivering to the Leaders’ Summit inSeptember a joint IMF-FSB synthesis paper highlighting the building blocks foreffective crypto policies.

The future of work is one where global employees have moreof a say in not only when, but how they get paid.
By Pranesh Anthapur, Kraken Chief People OfﬁcerPayroll capabilities are expanding alongside vast improvements to blockchaintechnology. With these innovations, global employees may want a wider range ofdigital asset options, such as NFTs (https://www.kraken.com/learn/what-are-non-fungible-tokens-nft), cryptocurrencies (https://www.kraken.com/learn/types-of-cryptocurrency), and bitcoin IRAs. Let’s explore why and how to empower employees with unprecedented control overtheir ﬁnancial future.The global case for crypto payroll(https://blog.kraken.com/)News(https://blog.kraken.com/category/news?view=archive)Product(https://blog.kraken.com/category/product)Crypto Education(https://blog.kraken.com/category/crypto-education) 1/24/24, 12:20 PMCrypto and the age of alternative payroll - Kraken Blog Kraken Blog
Page 2 of 6https://blog.kraken.com/news/industry-news/crypto-and-the-age-of-alternative-payrollAt Kraken, we are proud to offer Krakenites an automated way to receive their pay incrypto if they choose to. Many Krakenites are able to purchase crypto through netpayroll deductions every pay period, creating an easy way to dollar-cost average(https://www.kraken.com/learn/ﬁnance/dollar-cost-averaging) into a cryptocurrencyof their choice. More than one-third of our Krakenites choose to receive at least apartial paycheck in crypto. In fact, many of them choose to receive their entire salaryin crypto. Crypto payroll options are not just for those working in the crypto industry. In somecompanies, U.S.-based 401(k) retirement plan contributors can invest in bitcoinalongside stocks and mutual funds. The enthusiasm for cryptocurrency extends to thewider public. Research conducted by NYDIG (https://nydig.com/research/bitcoin-beneﬁts-2022-survey) reveals 36% of employees under 30 expressed interest in havingpart of their wages paid in bitcoin. In addition, about one-third of theseemployees – if given the opportunity to choose between two comparablepositions at different companies – would prefer the one that offered to pay themin bitcoin.A recent Aquent survey (https://brand.aquent.com/reimagining-compensation?)revealed younger generations are more open to the idea of crypto as analternative payroll option. Those aged 18-40 are most receptive: Millennials(55%) and Generation Z (56%). Baby Boomers (33%) are the least receptive.Bitcoin and Ethereum’s ether, the two most traded cryptocurrencies, are leadingthe way in popularity and investment enthusiasm. People of all ages tend tofavor bitcoin (62.7%) and ether (26.5%) compared to USDC (8.7%) and T ether(1.4%). This suggests that investors have conﬁdence in the potential proﬁt-making potential for these digital assets.An Investopedia survey (https://www.investopedia.com/younger-generations-bullish-on-cryptocurrencies-5223563) found Millennials are the most invested,with 38% already owning cryptocurrency. Cryptocurrency is well established as an investable asset and a global paymentmethod. But its long-term value proposition to businesses goes far beyond with morebeneﬁts worldwide.Five reasons to offer crypto as a payrolloption There are many advantages to integrating blockchain payments into yourorganization: Recruit top global talentCrypto, by nature, is globally inclusive (https://www.kraken.com/learn/what-makes-crypto-inclusive). Y ou can leverage crypto beneﬁts to recruit and retain top talent whomay not prefer to be paid in their local currency. Employers can send money globallywithout incurring the costs of traditional bank transfers or wires. 1/24/24, 12:20 PMCrypto and the age of alternative payroll - Kraken Blog Kraken Blog
Page 3 of 6https://blog.kraken.com/news/industry-news/crypto-and-the-age-of-alternative-payrollCrypto also gives employees the option to customize their beneﬁts package.Employees can allocate part of their net earnings to a choice of cryptocurrencies,such as bitcoin (https://www.kraken.com/prices/bitcoin), ether(https://www.kraken.com/prices/ethereum) and other stablecoins(https://www.kraken.com/learn/what-are-stablecoins).Secure payments at little costEmployers can now bypass establishing subsidiaries and creating bank accounts fortheir staff in different locations. With little cost, employees can establish their owncrypto wallet, also known as a hardware wallet (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WaxzDfJhZvM). This is a type of wallet used to store and secure cryptocurrency. It isa physical device that stores users’ private keys and public addresses in an offlineenvironment, providing an extra layer of security against online threats.Consider giving out a “hardware wallet bonus” on a new hire’s ﬁrst day. Y ou could alsoinclude a hardware wallet as part of new-hire onboarding. Wallets are typically a fewhundred dollars and can be a thoughtful perk to help your employees secure theirdigital assets. Dollar-cost averagingEvery payment period, employees have the opportunity to receive crypto, graduallyaccruing cryptoassets through dollar-cost averaging. This strategy involves investinga consistent amount of money in an asset at regular intervals. By adopting thisapproach, employees’ ﬁxed payment amounts will automatically purchase morecrypto when prices are lower, and less when prices are higher.Financial sovereigntyIn certain countries, employees can face high-inflation environments with their nativecurrencies. Crypto and stablecoins can offer an alternative to hyperinflationary localcurrencies, empowering employees to make their own ﬁnancial decisions. Offeringemployees their payroll in cryptocurrency is a great way to show that your companycares about their ﬁnancial freedom and sovereignty. Future-proof your employer brandBy the year 2025, three-quarters of the world’s workforce(https://teamstage.io/millennials-in-the-workplace-statistics/#:~:text=7.-,Millennials%20will%20represent%2075%25%20of%20the%20global%20workforce%20by%202025,the%20workforce%20will%20keep%20rising.)will be composed of millennials who will hold substantial influence over the future ofwork. Employees entering the workforce now look for forward-looking perks andbeneﬁts to support their lifestyles and values. If employers embrace the future digitaleconomy, they’ll modernize an employer brand ﬁt for the future of work.Things to consider about crypto payrollEven for a crypto-native company like Kraken, it is crucial to remain vigilant about theconstantly evolving landscape associated with crypto payroll. Consider the following:Ensuring regulatory compliance 1/24/24, 12:20 PMCrypto and the age of alternative payroll - Kraken Blog Kraken Blog
Page 4 of 6https://blog.kraken.com/news/industry-news/crypto-and-the-age-of-alternative-payrollDifferent countries have a variety of crypto regulations, and these laws can changequickly. Make sure to consult legal counsel and conﬁrm that any crypto payrollplatform you select has a built-in compliance layer.Understanding tax implicationsEmployers must understand tax regulations related to crypto payroll in theirjurisdictions. Different tax authorities may classify crypto payments differently,impacting tax obligations. Proper recordkeeping and reporting, includingdocumenting fair market value, are crucial for compliance.Withholding taxes from crypto payments, like traditional payroll, is important to avoidpenalties. Seeking professional advice from cryptocurrency tax specialists isadvisable due to the complexity of crypto payroll taxation.Managing securityUsing a crypto exchange for payroll can be risky as some exchanges are morevulnerable to hacking. Therefore, it is essential for companies to take extra securityprecautions (https://www.kraken.com/learn/videos/crypto-security-guide) when usingcrypto exchanges for payroll. Do your own research and ﬁnd trusted and securecrypto solutions. Build ﬁnancial freedom with cryptoIn light of existing and potential economic challenges, it is essential for employers torecognize the impact that employee compensation has on engagement andretention, as well as the growing demand for diverse payment options.By providing crypto as an alternative payroll choice and leveraging the potential ofblockchain-based compensation, employers can demonstrate innovation, fosterglobal inclusivity and take proactive measures for the future well-being of theiremployees.Are you or your company new to crypto?

SHAREThe Chainalysis 2024 CryptoCrime ReportComing soon
2023 was a year of recovery for cryptocurrency, as the industryrebounded from the scandals, blowups, and price declines of 2022.With crypto assets rebounding and market activity growing over thecourse of 2023, many believe that crypto winter is ending, and a newgrowth phase may soon be upon us. But what did all of that mean for crypto crime? Let’s look at the high-level trends.Reserve your copy 1/24/24, 12:19 PM2024 Crypto Crime Trends from Chainalysis

2023 saw a signiﬁcant drop in value received by illicit cryptocurrencyaddresses, to a total of $24.2 billion. As always, we have to caveat bysaying that these ﬁgures are lower bound estimates based on inﬂowsto the illicit addresses we’ve identiﬁed today. One year from now,these totals will almost certainly be higher, as we identify more illicitaddresses and incorporate their historic activity into our estimates. Forinstance, when we published our Crypto Crime Report last year, weestimated $20.6 billion worth of illicit transaction volume for 2022.One year later, our updated estimate for 2022 is $39.6 billion. Much ofthat growth came from the identiﬁcation of previously unknown,highly active addresses hosted by sanctioned services, as well as ouraddition of transaction volume associated with services in sanctionedjurisdictions to our illicit totals.Another key reason the new total is so much higher, besides theidentiﬁcation of new illicit addresses: We’re now counting the $8.7billion in creditor claims against FTX in our 2022 ﬁgures. In last year’s 1/24/24, 12:19 PM2024 Crypto Crime Trends from Chainalysis
Page 4 of 13https://www.chainalysis.com/blog/2024-crypto-crime-report-introduction/report, we said that we would hold off on including transactionvolumes associated with FTX and other ﬁrms that collapsed that yearunder allegedly fraudulent circumstances in our illicit totals until legalprocesses played out. Since then, a jury has convicted FTX’s formerCEO of fraud. Typically, we only include measurable on-chain activity in ourestimates for illicit activity. In the case of FTX, it is impossible to useon-chain data alone to measure the scope of the fraudulent activity,as there’s no way to isolate illegitimate movements of user funds. Assuch, we believe the $8.7 billion in creditor claims against FTX is thebest estimate to include. Given the size and impact of the FTXsituation, we are treating it as an exception to our usual on-chainmethodology. If courts convict in similar, ongoing cases, we plan toinclude their activity in our illicit transaction data as well in the future. All other totals exclude revenue from non-crypto native crime, such asconventional drug trafﬁcking in which crypto is used as a means ofpayment. Such transactions are virtually indistinguishable from licittransactions in on-chain data. Of course, law enforcement with off-chain context can still investigate these ﬂows using Chainalysissolutions. In cases where we’re able to conﬁrm such information, wecount the transactions as illicit in our data, but there are almostcertainly many instances where that isn’t the case, and therefore thenumbers wouldn’t be reﬂected in our totals. 1/24/24, 12:19 PM2024 Crypto Crime Trends from Chainalysis

We’re also seeing a shift in the types of assets involved incryptocurrency-based crime.
Through 2021, Bitcoin reigned supreme as the cryptocurrency of 1/24/24, 12:19 PM2024 Crypto Crime Trends from Chainalysis
Page 7 of 13https://www.chainalysis.com/blog/2024-crypto-crime-report-introduction/choice among cybercriminals, likely due to its high liquidity. But that’schanged over the last two years, with stablecoins now accounting forthe majority of all illicit transaction volume. This change also comesalongside recent growth in stablecoins’ share of all crypto activityoverall, including legitimate activity. However, stablecoin dominanceisn’t the case for all forms of cryptocurrency-based crime. 
Some forms of illicit cryptocurrency activity, such as darknet marketsales and ransomware extortion, still take place predominantly inBitcoin. [2] Others, like scamming and transactions associated withsanctioned entities, have shifted to stablecoins. Those also happen tobe the biggest forms of crypto crime by transaction volume, therebydriving the larger trend. Sanctioned entities, as well as thoseoperating in sanctioned jurisdictions or involved with terrorismﬁnancing, also have a greater incentive to use stablecoins, as theymay face more challenges accessing the U.S. dollar through traditionalmeans, but still want to beneﬁt from the stability it provides.

Page 8 of 13https://www.chainalysis.com/blog/2024-crypto-crime-report-introduction/illicit use, as Tether recently did with addresses linked to terrorism andwarfare in Israel and Ukraine.Below, we’ll look at three key trends that deﬁned crypto crime in 2023and will be important to watch moving forward. Scamming and Stolen Funds down bigCrypto scamming and hacking revenue both fell signiﬁcantly in 2023,with total illicit revenue for each down 29.2% and 54.3% respectively. As we discuss later in our scams section, many crypto scammers havenow adopted romance scam tactics, targeting individuals and buildingrelationships with them in order to pitch them on fraudulent investingopportunities, rather than advertising them far and wide, which oftenmakes them more difﬁcult to uncover. Although the FBI has publisheddata showing that reports of crypto investment scams in the U.S. hasbeen increasing year over year through 2022, our on-chain metricssuggest scamming revenues globally have been trending down since2021. We believe this aligns with the long-standing trend thatscamming is most successful when markets are up, exuberance ishigh, and people feel like they are missing out on an opportunity to getrich quickly. Of course, the impact of romance scams on individualvictims is devastating and should not be understated. And whileincreased reporting – at least in the U.S. – is a good sign, we stillbelieve insights into romance scams in particular suffer fromunderreporting. We hypothesize that the true damage of scamming isgreater than what reporting to the FBI and our on-chain metrics show,but overall, scamming is down, given broader market dynamics.  Crypto hacking, on the other hand, is much more difﬁcult for criminals 1/24/24, 12:19 PM2024 Crypto Crime Trends from Chainalysis
Page 9 of 13https://www.chainalysis.com/blog/2024-crypto-crime-report-introduction/to hide, as industry observers can quickly spot the unusual outﬂowsfrom a given service or protocol when a hack occurs. As we’ll discusslater, the decline in stolen funds is driven largely by a sharp dropoff inDeFi hacking. That dropoff could represent the reversal of a disturbing,long-term trend, and may signify that DeFi protocols are improvingtheir security practices. That said, stolen funds  metrics are heavilyoutlier-driven, and one large hack could again shift the trend.Ransomware and darknet marketactivity on the riseRansomware and darknet markets, on the other hand, are two of themost prominent forms of crypto crime that saw revenues rise in 2023,in contrast with overall trends. The growth of ransomware revenue isdisappointing following the sharp declines we covered last year, andsuggests that perhaps ransomware attackers have adjusted toorganizations’ cybersecurity improvements, a trend we ﬁrst reportedearlier this year. Similarly, this year’s growth in darknet market revenue also comesafter a 2022 decline in revenue. That decline was driven largely by theshutdown of Hydra, which was once the world’s most dominantmarket by far, capturing over 90% of all darknet market revenue at itspeak.

Sanctioned entities and jurisdictions together accountedfor a combined $14.9 billion worth of transaction volume in 2023,which represents 61.5% of all illicit transaction volume we measuredon the year. Most of this total is driven by cryptocurrency services thatwere sanctioned by the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Ofﬁce ofForeign Assets Control (OFAC), or are located in sanctionedjurisdictions, and can continue to operate because they’re injurisdictions where U.S. sanctions are not enforced. While those services can and have been used for nefarious purposes,it also means that some of that $14.9 billion in sanctions-relatedtransaction volume includes activity from average crypto users whohappen to reside in those jurisdictions.  For example, Russia-basedexchange Garantex, which was sanctioned by OFAC and OFSI in theU.K. for its facilitation of money laundering on behalf of ransomwareattackers and other cybercriminals, was one of the biggest drivers oftransaction volume associated with sanctioned entities in 2023.Garantex continues to operate because Russia does not enforce U.S.sanctions. So, does that mean all of Garantex’s transaction volume isassociated with ransomware and money laundering? No.Nevertheless, exposure to Garantex introduces serious sanctions riskfor crypto platforms subject to U.S. or U.K. jurisdiction, which meansthose platforms must remain ever-more vigilant and screen forexposure to Garantex in order to be compliant.More crypto crime insights to come 1/24/24, 12:19 PM2024 Crypto Crime Trends from Chainalysis

Posted on January 16, 2024   Economic sanctions are an important foreign policy tool that the U.S. uses to try and deter foreign states that are acting contrary to ourinterest or engaging in behavior such as human rights abuses. But increasingly, foreign states facing U.S. sanctions—including Iran and NorthKorea—are using digital assets to evade the impacts of those sanctions.Today’s WatchBlog post looks at our new report on how digital assets are being used to evade U.S. sanctions and what the federalgovernment is doing about it.
 How are digital assets being used to evade U.S. sanctions’ impacts?Sanctions can be used to place economic restrictions on entire countries, sectors of countries’ economies, individuals, or entities. Forexample, a sanction could deny a foreign government access to the U.S. financial system or freeze an entity’s assets under U.S. jurisdiction.These sanctions could impact the value of a country’s currency or its ability to fund its military or other projects.But sanctioned entities are using digital assets, like Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies, to hide their transactions. These alternative assetsalso can allow countries to generate funds from cybercrime and other illegal or illicit activities the U.S. looks to stem through sanctions. Forexample, in April 2023, Treasury made sanctions designations against two individuals located in China for laundering stolen virtual currency 1/24/24, 12:20 PMThe Effectiveness of Economic Sanctions At Risk from Digital Asset Growth | U.S. GAO
Page 2 of 3https://www.gao.gov/blog/effectiveness-economic-sanctions-risk-digital-asset-growthin support of North Korea’s weapons programs. What can be done about the challenges digital assets pose to U.S. sanctions?Digital assets have characteristics that make them attractive to those looking to avoid sanctions. For example, they enable users to rapidlytransfer value across borders and provide a level of anonymity. However, they also have limitations. For instance, federal agencies andprivate sector actors may be able to trace transactions and those making them on public blockchains.  Federal agencies that monitor illegal financial activities—such as the Departments of Justice and Treasury—have taken action to address therisks posed by digital assets. For example, in October 2022, the DOJ charged five Russian and two Venezuelan nationals for usingcryptocurrency to evade sanctions related to obtaining Venezuelan oil and U.S. military technology.The digital asset industry has also faced penalties for its role in these transactions. For example, in November 2023, the Treasuryannounced a financial settlement of nearly $4.4 billion with Binance Holdings Ltd. (a cryptocurrency exchange) and its affiliates forviolations of U.S. anti-money laundering and sanctions laws. More examples of enforcement actions are detailed in our new report.Federal agencies are also working with international organizations and partners to build investigative capacity and implement anti-moneylaundering standards. This promises to better protect global financial systems from having actors use digital assets for illicit purposes,including sanctions evasion.The risks digital assets pose to sanctions implementation will likely continue to evolve. An increase in the use and acceptance of digitalassets could erode the potency of U.S. sanctions and lead to greater sanctions evasion. On the other hand, advancements in capabilities totrace transactions and identify illicit actors could mitigate some sanctions evasion risks.Learn more about this issue and the actions federal agencies are taking to address it by checking out our new report.GAO’s fact-based, nonpartisan information helps Congress and federal agencies improve government.

By Allegra StrattonJanuary 24, 2024 at 11:00 AM CST
A party on the right of politics is choosing their candidate for the next election. You might think we’re talking about Donald Trump’s battle with Nikki Haley in NewHampshire, but we could also be talking about the UK.This morning, we woke up to reports of one Tory MP with a case of Republican primary-envy. Last night, Simon Clarke called for Rishi Sunak to be replaced by theTories to avoid the “impending catastrophe” of being “massacred” at the next election. For a few hours it wasn’t clear whether or not Clarke was part of a coordinatedcoup.Nope. Clarke was quickly put in a headlock by fellow MPs. Former home secretary Priti Patel issued her trademark scorn (Clarke had been “facile” and “divisive”), asdid party big wheels Liam Fox and David Davis. Clarke had been “silly,” according to Davis, the ultimate diss.For me, today has made it even more striking how we are straddling two parallel plot lines with both the US and UK weaving their way towards impending elections,often with disorientating eﬀect.“The die is cast” is how Bloomberg’s editorial board puts the New Hampshire result. Even though Haley is still vowing to ﬁght on, they say it is inevitable it’s him nother. The editorial is excoriating: “Recall that Trump was the ﬁrst president in about nine decades to lose the House, the Senate and the Oval Oﬃce in a single term.Remember, too, that in competitive races his preferred candidates underperformed by about 5 percentage points on average. Trump himself remains remarkablyunpopular, and he shows no inclination to widen his appeal.”There are a great number of ways Trump will impact the UK.

A 10% tariﬀ on all exports will of course aﬀect British businesses. Elsewhere, Trumpwalking away from Ukraine would crush its military and spirit. It would crumple a country the UK stands shoulder-to-shoulder with. And who does Putin invade next inEurope? Since this is our backyard, it’s an acute issue for us.But what about the eﬀect on the British election? The Trump 2.0 rhetoric seems to have gone up several decibels from last time, so imagine how a big polarizing claimdropped in, say, the second week of the campaign in the UK could upend things.The Tory voices angling to get rid of Sunak want a more Trumpian agenda with a harder line on immigration, so Sunak will come under constant pressure frombackbenchers like these to endorse some of Trump’s tirades. The defense of: “It’s not for me to comment on another country’s election” may work for a while. But ifthe US election is deafening, it may be hard to hold that line forever.

Mass timber is not the typical lumber that has structured single-family houses in North America for decades.The wood components are strong enough to hold up an oﬃce tower or apartment block, and building with them is thought to emit much less CO2 than using standardmaterials.

Page 2 of 8https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-01-21/apple-vision-pro-lack-of-netflix-youtube-app-store-tensions-threaten-device-lrnjwjb3The success of Apple Inc.’s Vision Pro, like many new technology platforms, will largely depend on support from third-party apps and services. And that’s an areawhere the device still faces plenty of questions.Some big name developers thus far aren’t doing much to help the device. Three of the world’s most popular streaming services — Netﬂix Inc., YouTube and SpotifyTechnology SA — have already signaled that they won’t be launching visionOS software or enabling their iPad apps to run on the Vision Pro.Other key developers, including iOS and iPadOS mainstays like Google and Meta Platforms Inc., also appear ready to shun the new platform at the outset. That’s abreak from the past.High-proﬁle developers previously made the jump to new Apple platforms right away. The App Stores on the iPhone and iPad were bursting with new titles quicklyafter their debuts, and both platforms now support millions of apps. The Vision Pro may be a diﬀerent story.The timing of the Vision Pro launch doesn’t help, coming at a particularly sensitive time for Apple and its developers. Software makers have fumed for years about AppStore policies, and Apple’s new approach to letting developers process payments outside their apps — but still pay Apple a commission of as much as 27% — isn’t sittingwell with some.Spotify blasted the new policy last week, saying that “Apple has demonstrated that they will stop at nothing to protect the proﬁts they exact on the backs of developersand consumers under their app store monopoly.”Apple has touted that the Vision Pro will run more than 1 million apps out of the box, including software from Walt Disney Co., TikTok, Amazon.com Inc., ParamountGlobal and many others. But I’d venture to guess that 99% of the total applications are iPad versions — rather than new software designed for the visionOS, theheadset’s operating system.Developers who oﬀer software for the iPad automatically see their apps pop up on the Vision Pro App Store. That is, unless they opt out — as Netﬂix, Spotify andThe Apple Vision Pro.Photographer: Philip Pacheco/Bloomberg 1/24/24, 12:11 PMApple Vision Pro: Lack of Netflix, YouTube, App Store Tensions Threaten Device - Bloomberg
Page 3 of 8https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-01-21/apple-vision-pro-lack-of-netflix-youtube-app-store-tensions-threaten-device-lrnjwjb3YouTube are planning to do.Even Apple itself hasn’t supported the new platform as robustly as it could. Though I hope this will be rectiﬁed soon, the company didn’t optimize some of its mostimportant apps for the Vision Pro. Surprisingly, Apple is running Podcasts, News, Calendar, Reminders and other essential apps in their iPad versions, withoutredesigned interfaces.I think there are a few key reasons for the less-than-expected amount of enthusiasm from developers:
The Vision Pro is an expensive, relatively low-volume product, and it’s going to be that way for a while. I’ve been told that Apple’s initial inventory for launch weekendis about 80,000 units, which the company sold out in the ﬁrst hour of preorders. If Apple sells the estimated 300,000 to 400,000 units that it’s expected to ship thisyear, that’s not much of a user base for developers — especially after the cut that the company takes from paid apps and services.Paul Haddad, a developer of popular iPad and iPhone apps, says he has little interest in exploring the potential of the Vision Pro. “I’m sure some people are willing tospend $3.5k to ﬁgure this out, I’m not one of them,” he wrote on the Mastodon social network.Other developers appear to be simply angry about Apple and its policies. Independent developer Aaron Vegh said on his blog that he had no idea whether the VisionPro would succeed. “But can I say this out loud?” he wrote. “How great would it be for this to fail?”Winning over gamers will be a major test for the platform. But that’s where the Vision Pro’s innovative interface is a drawback. It doesn’t ﬁt as well with some of themost popular VR games today — titles like Assassin’s Creed and Asgards Wrath 2 — that work best with VR-speciﬁc controllers.The Vision Pro does support PlayStation and Xbox controllers, but many developers who have already built titles for VR headsets prefer motion-based handBuilding software can be expensive, and developers want a returnon their investment. So some software makers are probablywaiting to see how big the Vision Pro market gets beforecommitting to a new application. This, however, doesn’t explainthe developers who actively choose to not support their iPad appon the device.1.
There are some developers that are angry at Apple for their AppStore review policies, fees and other practices — something that’scaught the eye of regulators. These developers know the VisionPro hinges on cool new apps and may not want to help Applemarket its device.2.Some developers feel that their applications don’t translate wellto the Vision Pro’s mixed-reality environment, which relies on eyemovement and hand gestures. Certain games are best played withVR hand controllers, something the Vision Pro doesn’t yet oﬀer.Also, developers don’t have full access to the eye-tracking andmotion-sensing features, making it harder to take advantage ofthe headset.3.
Developers saw the poor performance of Apple’s last three newApp Stores — ones for TV, watches and iMessage — and don’t wantto participate until they know if the Vision Pro version will besuccessful.4. 1/24/24, 12:11 PMApple Vision Pro: Lack of Netflix, YouTube, App Store Tensions Threaten Device - Bloomberg

There are plenty of Apple Arcade titles coming on board, though, including NBA 2K24 — in a particularly excitingdevelopment for Power On.Developers who favor touch-screen interfaces have their own gripes. Dave Wiskus, who runs independent streaming platform Nebula, wrote that “apps designedspeciﬁcally for touch don’t translate directly to the Vision Pro’s interaction model,” making them “kind of weird and unpredictable.”Lastly, there’s the issue of Apple’s previous App Stores. Developers who created software for the watch, Apple TV or iMessage now feel like those platforms are ghosttowns with little support.Though the Apple Watch is a successful product, it hasn’t become a haven for third-party software. Twitter, Uber, Slack and Facebook all built apps for the device, onlyto shutter them and abandon the platform.But hope springs eternal in some cases. Slack, now part of Salesforce Inc., is giving Apple another chance and releasing an app for the Vision Pro. Microsoft Corp. willbe on board as well with Oﬃce 365, alongside apps from Zoom Video Communications Inc. and Box Inc. The question now is how many others will join them.The Bench

On Sunday, Apple retail stores across the US are closing early to get trained onworking with the Vision Pro and how to sell the device. This follows secret brieﬁngs at the company’s headquarters, where hundreds of employees learned how to giveVision Pro demos in preparation for the product’s debut on Feb. 2.Now, more details are emerging about the sales procedures. I’m told that about 50 of Apple’s largest stores in the US will get a new seating area for demos. The setupwill include a pair of crescent-shaped benches with faux leather that let several customers sit down and try the device at once. There will even be carpet on the ﬂoor tomimic a living room. In Apple’s other stores, there will be a dedicated table with seating (similar to the image above) for users to go through the demo process.Another tidbit: If you ordered a Vision Pro for in-store pickup, you’ll be able to verify your face scan and ﬁt when you show up.
Apple Watch blood oxygen war could hurt the company’s future health-care plans. As Apple gets ready for its ﬁrst new product category in nearly a decade, it’sstill dealing with a crisis in its existing lineup. The company was forced — again — to stop selling watches with blood oxygen tracking. Last week, a federal appeals courtshot down Apple’s request for a longer pause on the International Trade Commission ban taking eﬀect. That left Apple with two choices: pulling the watch again or justremoving the feature.An Apple Watch Series 9 displaying the blood oxygen level detection settings.Photographer: Chris Delmas/AFP

And the shift was easy enough: Apple already sells watcheswith certain health features disabled due to regulatory rules. It just had to ﬂip that same switch for blood oxygen in the US. The big question is if the lack of the featurewill drive users away from the Apple Watch.I don’t think it will. But it’s still causing some problems for Apple. For one, it’s a huge embarrassment. The head of Masimo Corp., which kicked oﬀ this whole processby suing for patent infringement, is going on TV bashing Apple, asking for apologies and touting his own products. He’s in a unique position among Apple rivals. Noother company has successfully gotten the ITC to ban the sale of an Apple product in the US and make the mighty iPhone maker pull a feature.More importantly, though, the patent battle probably throws some of Apple’s future health capabilities into question. I reported last year that one of the big new healthfeatures coming in 2024 was sleep apnea detection. Everything I know about determining sleep apnea suggests that getting solid blood oxygen data through the night iscritical for an accurate result. So the battle over the sensor probably casts doubt on that too — at least, for now. 1/24/24, 12:11 PMApple Vision Pro: Lack of Netflix, YouTube, App Store Tensions Threaten Device - Bloomberg

Some interesting news from last weekend: A 121-person team tasked with validating Siri’saccuracy is shutting down and relocating. The company is folding the San Diego group into its sister organization in Austin and has oﬀered all California employees jobsand relocation packages to continue working at Apple. If they choose not to move to Texas, they’ll be terminated from the company at the end of April.Employees at the San Diego team are up in arms about the decision, which they say followed a period of unrest at the group. There have been complaints about poormorale, requests for higher pay and even talk of unionization over the past several months. So far, it sounds like the vast majority of the team will leave Apple ratherthan move to Texas. Though employees have the option of taking another job within Apple, most of them aren’t engineers and don’t feel like it will be easy to ﬁnd anew role.It’s a rare reshuﬄing for a company that hasn’t conducted mass layoﬀs in recent years. Instead, it’s been focused on tightening budgets and making small cuts on theedges.

Get ready for the company’s most important earnings report in a while, coming on the eve of the Vision Pro release.Investors and analysts aren’t expecting ﬁreworks: Apple has warned that revenue will be ﬂat in the quarter following its longest sales slump in decades. If the companydoes manage to eke out growth, it would be the ﬁrst revenue increase in a year. The iPhone, Apple’s biggest moneymaker, is contending with a lingering smartphoneslump — though it could beneﬁt from new features and the resolution of supply chain snags. In any case, Wall Street will be keeping a close eye on results out of China,where government bans of foreign technology have sparked concerns.Post Game Q&AQ: How was your Apple Vision Pro preorder experience?Q: Is the Vision Pro available through Apple’s discount stores, like the one for education customers?Q: What’s next for Apple once the Vision Pro is out of the gate?Email me, ask on the Power On Discord, or you can always send me a tweet or DM @markgurman.I’m on Signal at 413-340-6295; Wickr and Telegram at GurmanMark; or ProtonMail at markgurman@protonmail.com.More from BloombergGet Tech Daily and more Bloomberg Tech weeklies in your inbox:

Ever since taking on Netﬂix at its own game, old Hollywood has struggled to turn a proﬁt in streaming, with the likes of Disney+, Peacock and Paramount+ losingbillions of dollars each year, sparking concerns on Wall Street that the services will never be as proﬁtable as cable once was.But the age of streaming has been a boon for some unintended winners: pirates that use software to rip a ﬁlm or television show in seconds from legitimate onlinevideo platforms and host the titles on their own, illegitimate services, which rake in about $2 billion annually from ads and subscriptions.Photographer: Robert Way/Getty Images

But now piracyinvolving illegal streaming services as well as ﬁle-sharing costs the US economy about $30 billion in lost revenue a year and some 250,000 jobs, estimates the USIllustration: Maxime Mouysset for Bloomberg Businessweek

The global impact is about $71 billion annually.In the US, which counts almost 130 subscription piracy sites, the MPA estimates that the top three combined have about 2 million users paying $5 to $10 per month forﬁlms, TV shows and live sports. Analysts say the user number could soar as the cost of subscriptions from legitimate companies such as Walt Disney Co. approach $20per month as they seek to bolster the ﬁnances of their streaming platforms. “Some of these pirate websites have gotten more daily visits than some of the top 10legitimate sites,” says Karyn Temple, the MPA’s general counsel. “That really shows how proliﬁc they are.”Last year, Philadelphian Bill Omar Carrasquillo—who broadcast his lavish lifestyle to about 800,000 followers on YouTube and who the FBI said ran one of the most“brazen and successful” TV piracy schemes ever prosecuted by federal oﬃcials—was ordered to forfeit $30 million in assets including a dozen properties, aLamborghini and $6 million in cash. At its peak, the illicit streaming business GearsTV had 100,000 subscribers and brought in about $1.5 million in monthly sales. InMarch 2023, Carrasquillo was sentenced to ﬁve and a half years in prison.Some pirate sites are invitation-only platforms that can gain traction on the dark web. But most are legitimate-looking streaming websites, searchable on Google andadvertised on Facebook and TikTok. They’re funded by ads as well as subscriptions and oﬀer a buﬀet of ﬁlm, TV and live sports that’s wider in variety than legitimateoutﬁts because they usually steal content from multiple services. (In some cases, viewers mistake the platforms for legitimate streaming services because of how slickthey look.) Subscription payments are sometimes made in cryptocurrency, but they’re more often processed via credit cards and PayPal—which can help the MPA ﬁndthe businesses and shut them down.The MPA says that in recent months, Russian crime rings have paid patrons to sneak into theaters with camcorders and record ﬁlms including Book Club: The NextChapter, Barbarian, Smile and Lyle, Lyle, Crocodile at AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. theaters in Los Angeles. The footage is then uploaded to the internet andwatermarked with links to illegal online casinos owned and operated by the same criminal organizations, to encourage viewers to place bets on those gamblingplatforms.“The people who are stealing our movies and our television shows and operating piracy sites are not mom and pop operations,” says Charlie Rivkin, chief executiveoﬃcer of the MPA, who adds that some of the operators also engage in drug traﬃcking, child pornography, prostitution and money laundering. “This is organizedcrime.”Read more about how law enforcement and the industry is responding in Thomas Buckley’s story.Spies in the Boardroom 1/24/24, 12:16 PMPirate TV Websites Steal Content and Revenue From Netflix, Disney+ - Bloomberg

The trend is fueled by a recognition that investors face risks that go farbeyond interest rates, inﬂation and loan losses, and that it’s unwise to ignore geopolitics in any investment—particularly this year, with elections in dozens of countries.The possibility that a rogue political actor might upend market assumptions with a single action was cited as the top global risk in a recent poll of 500 institutionalinvestors by fund manager Natixis.“You come out of my line of work with honed instincts on what is really important and what is not,” says Jami Miscik, a CIA veteran and former US Navy admiral whonow works for Lazard. She jumped into action on Oct. 7 after the Hamas attack in Israel to outline the impact and outcomes for the bank.So what’s the appeal of the ﬁnance industry for an ex-CIA agent?

Some of it comes from his wealth. But another source of Musk’s power is hisknack for language—especially slogans, writes Max Cha%in of the Elon, Inc. podcast team. There’s “full self-driving,” the Muskism that refers to the company’s goal ofoperating a ﬂeet of robo-taxis. And of course “woke-mind virus,” Musk’s epidemiological gloss on leftism. There’s also “the future should look like the future,” Musk’stagline that attempts to make a virtue of his new pickup truck’s tendency to be the butt of design jokes.So in honor of Muskisms (and in an ode to all those who have tried this before us) tune in Wednesday night after the US markets close to play Tesla Earnings Bingo,where some of our favorite ‘isms’ may show up.
