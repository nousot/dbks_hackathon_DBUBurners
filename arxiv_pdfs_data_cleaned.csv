Abstract
Electronic health records (EHRs) contain a
wealth of valuable patient information embed-
ded within clinical notes. However, the ever-
increasing volume and complexity of these un-
structured clinical notes makes it extremely
challenging for researchers and clinicians to
manually locate and extract relevant infor-
mation in a timely manner. Intelligent sys-
tems that can understand clinical documents
and enable users to efficiently query and re-
trieve key details on demand are urgently
needed. In this work our aim is to de-
velop a natural language conversational inter-
face powered by state-of-the-art open source
large language models (LLMs) that allows
users to explore clinical notes through dy-
namic question-answering. A chatbot inter-
face was built using Langchain, a framework
for creating and managing applications pow-
ered by large language models, paired with
powerful transformer-based language models.
The system allows users to simply ask ques-
tions in natural language and receive answers
extracted from relevant parts of the clinical
notes. Extensive experiments were performed
to evaluate combinations of semantic embed-
ding models such as the state of the art Sen-
tenceTransformers framework, based on the
Sentence-BERT embedding models [1], and
advanced large language models on their abil-
ity to encode both queries and documents for
optimal information retrieval. Wizard Vicunademonstrated the highest accuracy due to its
13B parameters but required heavy compute.
To improve inference latency and deployabil-
ity, model optimization techniques like weight
quantization was utilized to reduce latency by
approximately 48times. While results are
promising, several limitations remain includ-
ing model hallucinations, and lack of robust
evaluation across diverse medical cases. Ad-
dressing these gaps represents important fu-
ture work to unlock the value in clinical notes
and advance clinical decision making through
AI.
1 Introduction
Electronic health record (EHR) systems have be-
come ubiquitous in modern healthcare environments
[2, 3, 4]. They offer an integrated digital repository
of patient health information collected from various
clinical encounters across time. EHRs may contain
a range of data including demographics, medical and
family histories, laboratory test results, radiology im-
ages, computed biosignals and crucially, clinical notes
generated by physicians, nurses and other providers.
These clinical notes, documenting physician-patient
interactions, encapsulate a wealth of vital information
about the patient’s conditions, treatments, care plans
and outcomes in rich natural language. However, a
significant limitation of EHRs is that critical patient
information is buried within large volumes of unstruc-
tured clinical notes that are challenging for providers
to efficiently search through and extract relevant de-
tails on demand. For instance, a newly assigned physi-
cian may need to rapidly comprehend a patient’s care
history across multiple specialists to make appropri-
1arXiv:2401.10733v1  [cs.IR]  19 Jan 2024 ate decisions. Or a researcher may want to analyze
treatment response patterns across populations. These
use cases require intelligently sifting through troves of
notes to pinpoint key facts, relationships and tempo-
ral trends - a formidable manual task. Hence, there is
a profound need for intelligent systems that can auto-
matically understand clinical notes written in natural
language and enable users to easily query and retrieve
targeted information on the fly through conversational
interactions.
Traditionally, information retrieval systems have
relied on methods like Boolean models, probabilis-
tic models, and term frequency-inverse document fre-
quency (TF-IDF) for surface-level matching of key-
words between queries and documents. While these
techniques have been useful for basic keyword-based
retrieval, they have their limitations. Boolean mod-
els utilize operators like AND, OR, and NOT to re-
trieve documents containing specific keyword combi-
nations, but they lack the ability to understand the nu-
ances and context of natural language queries. Prob-
abilistic models rank results based on keyword occur-
rences, which can be effective for certain tasks, but
they struggle to grasp the underlying meaning of the
text. TF-IDF is another widely used method that as-
signs weights to keywords in queries and documents
based on their rarity. This approach helps identify im-
portant terms, but it still falls short in capturing the
full semantic context and relationships between words.
However the primary constraint of these methods is
that they lack semantic understanding and the ability
to interpret context.
As a result, these traditional techniques often miss
relevant information when applied to complex natu-
ral language text. They fail to recognize synonyms,
antonyms, word variations, and other language intrica-
cies that are essential for accurate and comprehensive
information retrieval.
To overcome these limitations and unlock deeper
meaning, more advanced techniques such as natural
language methods based on large language models
(LLMs) [5] can be utilized. The rapidly advancing
LLMs, like GPT-3 and its successors, have revolution-
ized the field of natural language processing, with their
contextual understanding, generative capabilities, and
fine-tuning adaptability. Integrating LLMs into infor-
mation retrieval systems holds the potential to deliver
more accurate, insightful, and context-aware results,
transforming the way users access information in a
more personalized and efficient manner.
In this project we explore the utility of modern
natural language processing (NLP) methods based on
large language models (LLMs) to develop a conver-
sational agent or chatbot that allows users to explore
clinical notes through dynamic question answering. Byinterfacing with the chatbot in natural language as one
would with a human assistant, users can extract rele-
vant details buried within notes, facilitating improved
clinical care and research.

system based large language models that allows
natural language interaction for exploring clinical
notes

question answering system based on a medical
dataset

2 Related Work
2.1 LLMs in information retrieval
The intersection of Large Language Models (LLMs)
and Information Retrieval (IR) has emerged as a piv-
otal area of research, transforming traditional ap-
proaches and reshaping the landscape of information
access.
The work by Zhu et al. [6] provides a strong founda-
tion by offering a comprehensive survey of the diverse
applications of LLMs in different facets of IR, includ-
ing query rewriting, retrieval, re-ranking, and reading.
While their survey spans a wide array of studies, our
research takes a specific angle, honing in on the inte-
gration of LLMs in the information retrieval process.
2 Expanding upon this foundation, we delve into the po-
tential of enhancing traditional retrieval methods by
incorporating text generation capabilities. Our aim is
to provide a more natural and conversational interac-
tion between users and the system, ensuring a seamless
and user-friendly experience.
Another influential contribution in the realm of in-
formation retrieval is the tutorial presented by Begoli
et al. [7]. This tutorial focuses on advancing both
the theoretical and practical aspects of transformer-
based approaches, particularly with an emphasis on
efficiency and robustness in large-scale information
retrieval scenarios. The tutorial aims to equip the
audience with insights gained from developing and
fine-tuning transformer/BERT-based models for IR
tasks. In contrast, our approach focuses on the
utilization of off-the-shelf models, enabling the di-
rect retrieval of information from provided resources
without the need for intricate fine-tuning procedures.
This streamlined method significantly boosts usabil-
ity and efficiency, circumventing the time and com-
putational expenses associated with fine-tuning. Fur-
thermore, our research demonstrates that the accu-
racy achieved through our direct utilization method
surpasses that attained through domain-specific fine-
tuning processes.
2.2 Medical question answering using LLMs
In recent years, the field of medical question answering
has witnessed remarkable advancements, driven by the
integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into the
domain. The quest for expert-level performance in this
grand challenge has seen notable contributions from
various research works.
Lee et al. [8] address the unique challenges posed by
biomedical text mining. Recognizing the limitations
of applying general NLP advancements to biomed-
ical corpora, they introduce BioBERT, a domain-
specific language representation model pre-trained on
large-scale biomedical corpora. BioBERT outperforms
generic models like BERT and previous state-of-the-
art models in various biomedical text mining tasks, in-
cluding biomedical named entity recognition, biomed-
ical relation extraction, and biomedical question an-
swering.
Another work by Chakraborty et al. [9]emphasizes
the urgency of accelerating biomedical research in
light of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Introducing
BioMedBERT, a pre-trained model on the extensive
BREATHE v1.0 dataset, the authors showcase its ef-
ficacy in Question-Answering (QA) and Information
Retrieval (IR) tasks. The model achieves state-of-the-
art results on BioASQ datasets and exhibits superior
performance when coupled with Elasticsearch for IRtasks on the BioASQ dataset.
Singhal et al. [10] present Med-PaLM 2, a ground-
breaking development in medical question answering.
Addressing the inherent challenges in prior models,
Med-PaLM 2 leverages a combination of improvements
in base LLMs (specifically PaLM 2), medical domain
fine-tuning, and innovative prompting strategies, in-
cluding a novel ensemble refinement approach. The
model achieved an impressive score of up to 86.5% on
the MedQA dataset, surpassing its predecessor by over
19% and establishing a new state-of-the-art.
In contrast to the aforementioned works, our work
diverges by placing a specific emphasis on the inte-
gration of retrieval augmented generation for medical
question answering. While the discussed models, such
as Med-PaLM 2, BioBERT, and BioMedBERT, have
made significant strides in achieving expert-level per-
formance through advancements in base LLMs, do-
main fine-tuning, and innovative prompting strate-
gies, my approach focuses on enhancing deployability
and mitigating computational and time constraints.
The integration of retrieval augmented generation
aims to strike a balance between performance and re-
source efficiency, making the model more accessible for
widespread adoption in medical settings.
2.3 Impact of embedding models on output of
large language models source efficiency, making the model more accessible for
widespread adoption in medical settings.
2.3 Impact of embedding models on output of
large language models
The exploration of word embeddings and their influ-
ence on the output of large language models (LLMs)
is an under-explored but crucial aspect in natural lan-
guage processing (NLP). While numerous studies fo-
cus on the applications and performance of LLMs, the
specific impact of embedding models on their output
remains relatively uncharted territory.
The only relevant work in this area is the work by
Asudani et al. [11]. In this work the authors focuses on
the application of word embeddings and deep learning
models in the context of text analytics tasks. Through
a systematic literature review, the authors classify and
analyze relevant articles, highlighting the increasing
interest in employing these techniques for analysis and
prediction. The study categorizes literature based on
text analytics applications, encompassing areas like
text classification, sentiment analysis, named entity
recognition (NER), recommendation systems, biomed-
ical text mining, and topic modeling. The paper con-
cludes that utilizing domain-specific word embeddings
and the LSTM model can significantly enhance overall
text analytics task performance. In our investigation,
we direct our attention to a distinct domain that re-
mains unexplored in the aforementioned study — med-
ical question answering. Furthermore, we delve into
a different suite of embedding models and language
3 models, areas that Asudani et al. did not specifically
address in their research.
3 Approach
Our approach primarily utilizes Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) [12], a technique that merges the
power of pre-trained language models with the ben-
efits of external knowledge sources. RAG employs a
two-step process: a retrieval step that fetches relevant
documents from a vast corpus of text, and a genera-
tion step that crafts responses based on these retrieved
documents and the given input query.
This technique is particularly advantageous when
the required response includes information that the
language model has not encountered during its train-
ing. By combining the ability to generalize from lan-
guage model pretraining with the capacity to retrieve
specific details from external sources, RAG can gener-
ate highly detailed and accurate responses while avoid-
ing the overhead of fine tuning the language model on
specific datasets.
As illustrated in Figure 1 our approach consists of
two main phases: a) Ingestion b) Generation.
1. Ingestion
•Content Extraction: We begin by extract-
ing the content of the clinical documents
from the objects that encapsulate both the
content and metadata (i.e source path, file
size,...etc).
•Content Splitting: The loaded content is
then split into chucks. This step is crucial as
it breaks down the text into smaller units, to
comply with the embedding models context
size limitations. Throughout this step, we
intentionally allow for some overlap between
the different chunks. This strategy helps to
maintain the contextual integrity of the data.
•Text Embedding: Each chunk of text is
then transformed into an embedding. These
embeddings are numerical representations
that encapsulate the semantic meaning of
the text. The transformation process is car-
ried out by a distinct embedding model, the
details of which will be discussed later.
•Vector Store: The embeddings, along with
some reference to the original content the
embedding was created from, are subse-
quently stored in a vector database or vector
store, which forms the backbone of our re-
trieval system.
2. Generation•Document Retrieval: The user input
query is processed using the same process
described above 1. After that, an index –
a data structure designed for quick retrieval
– is used by a retriever component to scan
the vector store. Using a cosine similarity,
the retriever identifies and returns the most
relevant documents to the user’s input query.
•Output Generation: The re-ranked vec-
tors, which represent the selected docu-
ments, along with the input prompt, are
passed to a language model. This model is
responsible for text summarization and final
output generation, and it is distinct from the
earlier mentioned embedding model.
The embedding model and the language model are
two separate but integral components of our system.
The embedding model is used to transform raw text
into meaningful numerical representations, while the
language model generates coherent and contextually
appropriate text. A summary of the distinguish be-
tween embedding and language models is shown in ta-
ble 3
To achieve the previously described pipeline we uti-
lized a tool called Langchain. LangChain is a powerful
and versatile Python framework designed to facilitate
the development of state-of-the-art language models
and their applications. It offers a wide range of pre-
configured models and utilities that allow researchers
and developers to focus on the creative aspects of
their projects, rather than spending time on repeti-
tive and time-consuming tasks such as model config-
uration, training, and deployment. With its modular
and flexible design, LangChain allows users to easily
integrate various components and adapt them to their
specific needs.
In our approach, we leveraged multiple components
of the LangChain framework. First, we used the Doc-
ument Store component for efficiently storing and
retrieving documents. This component allowed us to of the LangChain framework. First, we used the Doc-
ument Store component for efficiently storing and
retrieving documents. This component allowed us to
create a robust retrieval system, which is a crucial as-
pect of our RAG model. The Document Store uses a
vector database to store embeddings and references to
the original content, providing a fast and scalable so-
lution for storing and retrieving large volumes of data.
Second, we employed LangChain’s Retriever com-
ponent for document retrieval. The retriever uses an
index, a data structure designed for quick retrieval, to
scan the vector store. Using cosine similarity, it iden-
tifies and returns the most relevant documents to the
user’s input query. This component’s ability to quickly
and accurately retrieve relevant documents is essential
for the successful application of our RAG model.

Table 1: Embedding vs Language models
We also integrated LangChain’s Memory compo-
nent into our system. In the context of language model
applications, especially those involving conversational
interfaces, the ability to refer to information from ear-
lier interactions is crucial. This is where the Memory
component comes into play. The Memory component
in LangChain offers utilities for storing information
about past interactions, acting like a conversation his-
tory that can be read from and written to. By inte-
grating this component into our system, we have not
only improved the quality of the responses generated
but also ensured a more natural and human-like con-
versational experience.
Lastly, we implemented the Chain component pro-
vided by LangChain, which was instrumental in devel-
oping our more complex system requirements. Chains
allowed us to create coherent workflows, linking mul-
tiple components together. For instance, we created a
chain that takes user input, formats it with a specific
template, and then passes the formatted response to
the language model for generation.
4 Dataset
The Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care
(MIMIC-IV) [13] , is a single-center dataset encom-
passing information about over 40k patients admitted
to intensive care units (ICUs) at at the Beth Israel
Deaconess Medical Center (BIDMC). This dataset in-
cludes a comprehensive range of data such as medi-
cations, laboratory measurements, observations, vitalsigns, care provider notes, procedure codes, fluid bal-
ance, diagnostic codes, hospital length of stay, imaging
reports, survival data, and more. MIMIC-IV serves a
vital role in various applications, supporting industrial
research, academic endeavors, and initiatives for qual-
ity improvement.
In addition to the MIMIC-IV dataset,we also uti-
lized the MIMIC-IV-Note [14], which offers deidenti-
fied free-text clinical notes for patients included in the
MIMIC-IV clinical database. MIMIC-IV-Note con-
tains over 331k discharge summaries. It also includes
over 2 million radiology reports. These notes have un-
dergone deidentification, ensuring the removal of pro-
tected health information (PHI) in accordance with
the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability
Act (HIPAA) Safe Harbor provision. MIMIC-IV-Note
allows researchers to study clinical natural language
processing and related areas by providing context to
the clinical data within MIMIC-IV.
Just like their predecessors, MIMIC-IV and
MIMIC-IV-Note are freely available, but accessing
them requires undergoing CITI training. This train-
ing provides materials on maintaining patient privacy,
handling medical records responsibly, and importantly,
it includes the necessary Health Insurance Portability
and Accountability Act (HIPAA) training, as the data
originates from the United States.
The dataset itself is substantial and comes in CSV
files, along with SQL scripts that facilitate loading the
data into the RDS (Relational Database Service). This

4.1 Data Preprocessing
The preprocessing steps undertaken for this study are
outlined below:
1. Extraction of Relevant Fields: To streamline the
dataset and focus on the most pertinent informa-
tion, only the fields that are directly relevant toour analysis were extracted. This not only helps
in reducing the data’s dimensionality but also en-
sures that only the most meaningful attributes are
considered for subsequent stages. Relevant fields
included: Subject (patient) ID, Gender, Race,
Time when note was taken, Age when note was
taken, Admission type and note text.
2. Handling Missing Values: For the integrity of our
analyses, records containing empty or null values
were dropped. This decision was made to prevent
potential biases or inaccuracies in the analysis due
to incomplete data.
5 Evaluation
5.1 Model Pairing Accuracy
In our initial evaluation phase, we aimed to assess the
impact of various combinations of embedding and lan-
guage models on the precision of the results. From the
Hugging Face’s Open LLM leaderboard [15, 16], we se-
lected a diverse set of 10 language models and paired
them with 6 distinct embedding models to compre-
hensively gauge their performance. Table 3 provides
an overview of the various models employed. It’s im-
portant to note that the selection of these models was
influenced by our hardware constraints. Additionally,
models with fewer than 3B parameters exhibited re-
duced accuracy, indicating saturation.
5.1.1 Experimental Setup
For our preliminary set of evaluations, we crafted five
question-answer pairs based on five different notes
from the MIMIC dataset that we curated earlier to
serve as our evaluation metric. Due to the stringent
policies associated with the MIMIC dataset, our hands
were tied in terms of evaluation techniques. As a re-
sult, commercially acclaimed state-of-the-art models,
such as OpenAI’s GPT-4, were off the table. This
limitation necessitated manual evaluation of the out-
puts produced by the selected embedding and language
model pairs, ensuring adherence to dataset guidelines
while striving for accuracy in our analysis.
5.1.2 Results
Figure 4 illustrates the accuracy outcomes for vari-
ous pairings of embedding and language models. The
figure reveals that the ”Wizard Vicuna” model, a
13 Billion-parameter derivative of the Meta LLaMA
model further refined using conversations from the
’ShareGPT’ website [26], achieved the top accuracy
(80%) when paired with the ”Sentence Transformers:
Language-agnostic sentence embedding” model.

els
5.2 Single Document Evaluations
For both single and multi-document evaluations 5.3,
we employed synthetic data that closely mirrors the
structure of the MIMIC dataset. This approach was
taken to enable the utilization of OpenAI’s GPT-4 in
deriving the ground truth answers. The synthetic na-
ture of the data ensured that we comply with the terms
of use for the MIMIC dataset, while maintaining a
structure similar to the original dataset for relevance
and applicability. Table 4 compares the outputs of
two sample questions asked to both our model and the
OpenAI GPT-4 models. We also report the inference
time of our model.
5.3 Multi Documents Evaluations
Next, we employed multiple documents in parallel to
assess our approach in a real-world context. Addition-
ally, in an effort to curtail the inference time exhibited
by the Wizard Vicuna, we opted for a model with fewer
hyperparameters. Consequently, we selected the 3B
Google Flan xl model for this purpose. The inference
time as well as the output of using both models are
reported in table 5.3.The table illustrates that Wizard
Vicuna boasts an accuracy rate of 100%, outperform-
ing the Flan T5 model’s 60% accuracy. However, this
comes at a cost: Wizard Vicuna’s inference time isover 24 times longer than that of Flan T5.
5.4 Model optimization
In pursuit of enhancing the inference speed of Wizard
Vicuna without compromising the impressive accuracy
we’ve attained, we turned our attention to model op-
timization. Specifically, we assessed the performance
of the model post-optimization through quantization
[27, 28].
Large Language Models (LLMs), while being re-
markably powerful, often grapple with substantial
memory and computational overhead. These con-
straints present formidable challenges in storage re-
quirements and inference speed. A viable solution
to alleviate these challenges is quantization. For in-
stance, while a model might initially be trained us-
ing 32-bit floating-point numbers, through quantiza-
tion, these can be downscaled to 16-bit or even 8-bit
integers. Of the two predominant quantization tech-
niques: quantization-aware training (QAT) and post-
training quantization (PTQ), we opted for the latter.
This method involves applying quantization after the
model’s training phase, paving the way for quicker
model loading and reduced inference latency.
Table 6 shows the efficiency gains achieved through
quantization. Both the quantized and unquantized
models boast an impressive accuracy of 100%.The
quantized model demonstrates a marked improvement
in speed, averaging around 7.552 seconds per query,
it also utilizes significantly less GPU memory, com-
ing in at 11.93 GB out of the available 32GB. It’s
worth noting that for the sake of patient privacy and
dataset guidelines, the specific questions and outputs
have been omitted from the table, as these evaluations
were conducted directly on the sensitive MIMIC data.

5.5 Domain specific fine tuning
In our concluding set of evaluations, we shifted our fo-
cus to the fine-tuning of the Wizard Vicuna 7B model.
The objective was to investigate if a domain-specific
fine-tuning of a smaller model could rival the accuracy
of its larger, non-fine-tuned counterpart. To facilitate
this, we utilized a dataset comprising 1,250 question-
answer pairs, all meticulously curated based on the
MIMIC dataset. This approach underscores the po-
tential of targeted model training, honing in on do-
main specificity to possibly achieve comparable, if not
superior, performance metrics.
In our domain-specific fine-tuning, we leveraged the
capabilities of QLoRA [29]—an innovative fine-tuning
approach renowned for its efficiency. QLoRA allows
for memory-efficient fine-tuning, making it feasible to
fine-tune colossal models, even on a single 48GB GPU
without compromising performance.
Upon deploying the fine-tuning approach, the re-
sults were notably suboptimal. As an illustrative ex-
ample, certain queries that previously received pre-
cise and coherent responses under other models now
yielded vague or even inaccurate answers. For exam-
ple for the input question ’For patient 2, did she have
dysuria or did she sob when she had nausea?’, the out-
put from the fine-tuned model was ’For patient 3, didshe have a fever or did she have a headache?For pa-
tient 4, did she have a cough or did she have a sore
throat? For patient 5, did she have a runny nose or
did she have a sneeze?’, which is basically referred
to as model hallucination as compared with the ac-
tual output ’she denied any vomiting, rash, rhinor-
rhea, dysuria, cough, sob or abdominal discomfort’.
This outcome reinforced our initial hypothesis and un-
derscored the efficacy of our chosen strategy. The
utilization of the RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Genera-
tion) framework has consistently demonstrated supe-
rior performance in the realm of information retrieval
with LLMs. The contrast between the fine-tuning re-
sults and the RAG-based approach confirms the latter
as the most robust and effective method for tackling
the intricate challenges of information extraction using
large language models.
6 Limitations and Future Work
Throughout this research, we encountered several con-
straints:
•GPU RAM Constraints: Models, particularly
those having 13 billion parameters or more, de-
manded significant GPU RAM, which at times
limited the extent of our experiments.
•Fine-Tuning Overheads: The associated compu-
tational and time costs of fine-tuning large mod-
els restricted the range of experiments we could
conduct.
•Evaluation Challenges: Establishing an appropri-
ate evaluation mechanism was challenging. Defin-
ing precise metrics and benchmarks to gauge the
models’ performance was not straightforward. •Evaluation Challenges: Establishing an appropri-

ors include packaging the chatbot within an appli-

ability, and accessibility.
•Evaluation Strategies: A paramount next step in-
volves formulating a more structured approach to
testing and evaluation, ensuring that results are
consistent and repeatable across various settings.
•Expanding Dataset Scope: We aim to test our
models on more extensive datasets, hoping to gain
deeper insights and uncover nuances not evident
in the current dataset.
7 Conclusion
In the rapidly evolving landscape of Electronic Health
Records (EHRs), the vast and intricate nature of clin-
ical notes poses significant challenges for manual re-
trieval and analysis. The presented work offers a
transformative solution by harnessing the power of
state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs) to
develop a dynamic conversational interface for clini-
cal note exploration. Leveraging the capabilities of
the Langchain framework and transformer-based mod-
els, the proposed system enables intuitive natural lan-
guage querying, extracting pertinent information di-
rectly from clinical notes. Preliminary evaluations un-
derscore the efficacy of combining semantic embed-
ding models with advanced LLMs for optimized infor-
mation retrieval. Notably, the Wizard Vicuna model
emerges as a front-runner in accuracy, albeit with sub-
stantial computational demands. Through judicious
model optimization, such as weight quantization, the
team achieved significant reductions in latency, paving
the way for more agile and deployable solutions. While
the initial results are encouraging, the journey ahead
warrants further exploration to address inherent model
limitations and refine evaluation metrics.

Abstract
Large Language Models (LLMs) are vulnerable to ‘Jailbreaking’ prompts, a type
of attack that can coax these models into generating harmful and illegal content. In
this paper, we show that pruning up to 20% of LLM parameters markedly increases
their resistance to such attacks without additional training and without sacrificing
their performance in standard benchmarks. Intriguingly, we discovered that the
enhanced safety observed post-pruning correlates to the initial safety training level
of the model, hinting that the effect of pruning could be more general and may
hold for other LLM behaviors beyond safety. Additionally, we introduce a curated
dataset of 225 harmful tasks across five categories, inserted into ten different
Jailbreaking prompts, showing that pruning aids LLMs in concentrating attention
on task-relevant tokens in jailbreaking prompts. Lastly, our experiments reveal that
the prominent chat models, such as LLaMA-2 Chat, Vicuna, and Mistral Instruct
exhibit high susceptibility to jailbreaking attacks, with some categories achieving
nearly 70-100% success rate. These insights underline the potential of pruning as a
generalizable approach for improving LLM safety, reliability, and potentially other
desired behaviors.
1 Introduction
Large language models, or LLMs, have seen a massive increase in both capabilities and usage in
recent years. With the release of ChatGPT[ 17], these models have received an unprecedented amount
of attention from users. To reduce the risk of generating dangerous or sensitive content, LLMs are
often further fine-tuned to be aligned with human values[ 26]. However, the increase in popularity of
LLMs has also come with advances in adversarial prompts, known as jailbreaks, as users attempt to
bypass the safety alignment of these models. Furthermore, due to these LLMs’ large size and demand,
deployment is a significant challenge, encouraging the use of techniques like model compression
to scale well. The effects of compression on safety are not easily characterized, as demonstrated by
compression of computer vision models being shown to have mixed results with regards to preserving
adversarial robustness[ 7]. With the widespread deployment and usage of LLMs, understanding
the potential effects of compression and possible mitigations becomes necessary for ensuring safe
models.
In this study, we investigate the effects of pruning on the safety alignment of large language models
(LLMs). We curated a dataset of 2250 prompts designed to elicit malicious outputs from LLMs. Our
focus was on three 7 billion parameter models: LLaMA-2 Chat [ 26], Vicuna-1.3 [ 3], and Mistral
Instruct v0.2 [ 12]. LLaMA-2 Chat was finetuned from the base LLaMA-2 model and then underwent
additional safety alignment via reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF). Vicuna 1.3,
derived from the original LLaMA model, was fine-tuned using the ShareGPT dataset, while Mistral
Instruct v0.2 was fine-tuned from the base Mistral Model, with neither receiving RLHF training.
Our approach was to examine the refusal rates for the malicious prompts in the unpruned models
compared to their pruned versions, observing the changes at varying levels of model compression. OurarXiv:2401.10862v1  [cs.LG]  19 Jan 2024 findings reveal an initial increase in resistance to jailbreaking prompts with light pruning, followed
by a decline in safety when the pruning exceeds a certain threshold.
Notably, LLaMA-2 Chat demonstrated the highest resilience against jailbreaking prompts and showed
the most significant safety improvement with parameter pruning. Conversely, Mistral Instruct v0.2
was the least resilient before pruning and exhibited minimal safety improvement post-pruning.
Furthermore, we found that pruning helps the models to concentrate their attention on the task
tokens. We speculate that attention concentration aids the models in detecting malicious tasks and is
responsible for safety improvement. These observations suggest that moderate parameter pruning can
potentially enhance the desired behaviors in LLMs under threat models.
To summarize, our contributions are as follows:
•We curated and open-sourced a new dataset to study safety in LLMs. This dataset includes
225 malicious tasks drawn from five overarching categories. We consider 10 types of
jail-breaking methods and each task was inserted into each jailbreaking prompt.
•We leveraged a recently introduced pruning algorithm [ 25] to increase LLM safety under
jailbreaking attacks. We showed that our method provides consistent safety improvements
across a variety of tasks under jailbreaking attacks, and the improvement is dependent on
the level of safety training in the unpruned model.
•We analyzed the attention maps of both the pruned and unpruned models and found that the
attention map of the pruned models is significantly more concentrated on the task tokens.
We release our dataset and implementation in hopes of supporting research in this essential field at

2 2 Background
In the following section, we provide background on key concepts for this work.
2.1 Safety in Large Language Models (LLMs)
Large Language Models have demonstrated a remarkable ability to generate high-quality responses
to human prompts. However, due to the massively crawled datasets that these models were trained
on and the versatility of prompts that these models can respond to, they are also able to generate
dangerous or objectionable content, including hallucinating false information, producing polarizing
content, and giving instructions for harmful or illegal actions [ 19]. To reduce the risk of generating
such content, several techniques have been adopted to better align the model with human values.
Notably, fine-tuning with Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) is effective for
both improving the quality of responses and filtering the outputs of the model to be safer [ 19,26].
Additionally, a teacher-student distillation approach introduced by LLaMA [ 26] has been shown
to improve the model’s safety scores. Researchers have also developed a gradient-based defense
mechanism for jailbreaking prompts which has a computation overhead [ 22]. Lastly, researchers
in [24] have shown that low-rank layer pruning can in fact improve an LLM’s reasoning abilities
without further training.
2.2 Model Compression
Numerous model compression techniques [ 10,13,15] have been developed and successfully applied
to neural networks. Classes of methods such as pruning, quantization, knowledge distillation, or
low-rank factorization all aim to reduce model size while maintaining performance. Practitioners
employ these methods when deploying neural networks to increase computational efficiency at
inference time. The widespread adaptation of these techniques makes understanding their effects on
model properties such as generalization and robustness vital. Reviews such as [ 21] reveal conflicting
experimental results and suggest that particular compression methods and implementation details can
lead to either improvements in robustness [ 9] or a trade-off [ 8] between the two. In this work, we
study a particularly promising LLM pruning method and its effects on model safety from jailbreak
attempts.
2.2.1 Wanda Pruning
Recent progress in natural language processing has largely been driven by scaling up transformer
networks towards parameter counts in the trillions. Some state-of-the-art models are GPT-3 [ 2],
which has 175 billion parameters, or PaLM [ 4], which has 540 billion parameters. There has been
a lot of interest in developing compression techniques for LLMs that maintain performance while
lowering parameter count in order to more efficiently deploy these models at scale. We turn our
attention to Wanda[ 25], a recently introduced pruning method that is computationally efficient, does
not require any finetuning, and maintains good performance.
Consider a linear layer W∈RCout×Cin, and a batched input X∈RT×Cin. In LLMs, T=N·L
represents the total token count, where Nis the batch size and Lthe sequence length. Wanda assigns
an importance score for each weight
Sij=|Wij| × ∥Xj∥2
where ∥Xj∥2is the l2norm of X[:, j]. They consider an output index iand construct the sets of all
weights connecting into i:{Wuv|u=i}. Finally, they remove all the lowest s%connections in
each of these groups where s%is the target sparsity.
2.2.2 Related Work
[24] introduce LAyer-SElective Rank reduction (LASER) and analyze an orthogonal compression
technique to us, low-rank factorization They observe performance gains across multiple reasoning
tasks including TruthfulQA [1], Bios Gender and Bios Profession [5].
Conversely, [ 11] look at pruning and quantization methods, including Wanda, and introduce reasoning
tasks where these methods negatively impact performance.
We contribute to this line of work and consider a novel and vital evaluation axis when analyzing
3 LLMs: resilience to adversarial attacks on safety alignment. We show that in certain cases, similar
to low-rank factorization for reasoning and in contrast with some Wanda truthfulness evaluations,
Wanda pruning seems to improve model performance.
2.3 Adversarial Attacks on LLMs
There is much interest in finding ways to get around the safety filters of LLMs and induce the model
into producing harmful or sensitive output. With the release of ChatGPT, there has been a spread of
various “jailbreaks"", in which users carefully engineer prompts in order to ignore underlying system
prompts or disregard its safety training. These prompts include instructing the LLM to roleplay in an
unsafe manner, and avoiding safety mechanisms with unusual scenarios [ 6], [27]. While providers of
closed-source LLMs like OpenAI have attempted to patch jailbreaks as they are found, many remain
effective.
3 Method
In this section, we provide an overview of our methodology, including our dataset curation, levels of
model compression used, and method for evaluating jailbreaking success.
3.1 Dataset
We curated a dataset of 225 hypothetical malicious tasks, representative of various types of malicious
intents. The tasks were specifically designed to test the resilience of LLMs against various forms of
unethical exploitation while strictly adhering to ethical guidelines to ensure they remain hypothetical
and non-functional in nature. The tasks were divided into five categories, namely, 1) Misinformation
and Disinformation, 2) Security Threats and Cybercrimes, 3) Unlawful Behaviors and Activities, 4)
Hate Speech and Discrimination, and 5) Substance Abuse and Dangerous Practices. Each category
has 45 tasks divided into low, medium, and high severity.
Figure 1: Five categories of malicious tasks in our dataset. Each category has 45 tasks divided equally
into low, medium and high severity.
For jailbreaking prompts, we followed previous research such as [ 27] and [ 14] and considered three
types of jailbreaking attacks, namely Role-playing, Attention-shifting, and Privileged executions.
In our dataset, there were 4 Role-playing prompts, 3 Attention-Shifting Prompts, and 3 Privileged
Execution Prompts. In each jailbreaking prompt, we inserted the above 225 malicious tasks. For the
baseline, we also kept the malicious tasks without the prompts. Therefore, in total our dataset had
225×11 = 2475 examples.
3.2 Models
For the base models that we compressed to obtain our pruned models, we used three 7-billion
parameter FP16 models, namely, LLaMA-2-Chat, Vicuna 1.3 and Mistral Instruct v0.2.
LLaMA-2 Chat has undergone safety alignment by fine-tuning and using Reinforcement Learning
with Human Feedback [ 26], enabling it to avoid generating harmful or misleading content. Vicuna
1.3 was fine-tuned from the original LLaMA model using the ShareGPT dataset [ 3]. Lastly Mistral
model is a new model architecture introduced in [ 12]. This model was also fine-tuned but went
through less safety training compared to both LLaMA-2 Chat and Vicuna.
4 Next, we used the Wanda method [ 25] to prune each of the base models to 10%,20%, and 30%
sparsity. The pruned models were not fine-tuned.
3.3 Response Evaluation
Figure 2: For each malicious task in each jailbreaking prompt, we generated responses from both the
unpruned base model and 10-30% pruned models. Each response is then classified into one of the
three categories by a custom fine-tuned ChatGPT-3.5 Turbo model.
For each entry in the dataset, we obtained the responses of the base model and the pruned models.
Each response from the models was classified into three categories as follows:
•Refused: If the model refuses to attempt the task and the response contains no information
relevant to completing the task.
•Incomplete: If the LLM attempts the task, but the response is irrelevant, inadequate, or
wrong.
•Correct: If the model correctly completes the task somewhere in the response.
For evaluation, we first labeled a dataset of 150 training examples and 59 validation examples sampled
from both the pruned and the unpruned models. Then we fine-tuned a ChatGPT-3.5 Turbo model
[18] on this dataset. This model achieved 100% accuracy on both training and validation examples.
We used this fine-tuned model to evaluate all the outputs of our compressed models.
Figure 2 provides a visual overview of our experimental methodology. Initially, responses generated
by our fine-tuned ChatGPT model are classified into three categories: Refused, Incomplete, or Correct.
These initial classifications undergo manual verification by hand. Subsequently, responses classified
as Incomplete or Correct are considered instances of successful jailbreaking, whereas all others are
deemed unsuccessful. This dual-phase categorization offers a comprehensive measure of jailbreaking
effectiveness, distinguishing between the model’s response generation ability and the actual success
of the prompts in eliciting desired responses.
Figure 10 shows the system and the user prompts that were used for the ChatGPT-3.5 Turbo model.
In almost all cases, the ChatGPT model returned just the category name. However, in three instances,
the ChatGPT model returned no category name. Those three responses were classified by hand.
3.4 Benchmarking on Standard Tasks
It is known that aggressive pruning reduces an LLM’s overall abilities [ 25] and therefore, we need to
benchmark the pruned models’ performances across various tasks to ensure that the pruned models
are still capable. For this reason, we chose to benchmark the models on Huggingface’s Open LLM
Leaderboard [ 1], which consists of 7 benchmarks (6 tasks and the average performance on these
5 tasks). Additionally, we measured the pruned models’ perplexities on the WikiText dataset [ 16] and
the effective context length using the AltQA dataset [20]. The latter evaluates the models’ ability to
retrieve numerical answers to questions given long documents, which in our case was roughly 2k
tokens to accommodate the maximum context length of our models. High performance on this task
would indicate that long-range dependencies are still captured and therefore that the increased length
of jailbreaking prompts does not affect the understanding of the malicious task.

Figure 3: The top row illustrates the comparison of pruning effects for each jailbreaking prompt, the
middle row aggregates the results by categories, while the bottom row aggregates the results based on
severity levels. Pruning 20% of the weights results in an increased refusal rate for both the Vicuna 1.3
and LLaMA-2 Chat models However, pruning 30% weights hurts the safety of LLaMA-2 and shows
reduced improvement for Vicuna. In contrast, Mistral Instruct v0.2 shows small but inconsistent
changes post-pruning.
4.1 Quantitative Evaluation
We quantitatively measured the models’ resistance to generating harmful content. We display the
comparisons of the jailbreaking success rates for our various models in Figure 3, providing a more
detailed breakdown of the results in the Supplementary Material. As a general trend, we note that
across the 5 types of malicious tasks, the average jailbreaking success rate varies significantly for
different models. Figure 4 shows a comparison of the three base models.
We observe that the Mistral model is the most susceptible to jailbreaking attacks and in some
categories fails to refuse any task. In contrast, LLaMA-2 Chat is the most resilient model. However,
even for LLaMA-2, the Misinformation category displays an unusually high success rate across all
models, suggesting that at least the base model LLaMA-2-Chat is particularly susceptible to requests
for generating misleading or false information.
From the pruning comparison results in Figure 3, there is a clear trend of decreasing jailbreaking
success, or increasing jailbreaking resistance, as the sparsity increases from 0 to 20%. However, once

the sparsity reaches 30%, the jailbreaking resistance decreases to the point that the pruned model is
worse than the original. This suggests that smaller amounts of pruning can be used to improve the
safety of LLMs, but too much will negatively affect the alignment training of the models.
The improvement degree depends on the initial model’s safety. LLaMA-2 Chat, the safest model
initially, showed the highest safety improvement after pruning. On the other hand, Mistral Instruct
v0.2, starting as the least safe model, exhibited no improvement post-pruning. This suggests pruning
can intensify alignment effects, especially under jailbreaking attacks.
4.2 Qualitative Comparison
We also qualitatively looked into responses generated by all the models. Table 1 Shows one example
response from the base model and the pruned models. We did not find a noticeable degradation in
the quality of the responses generated by the pruned models. We noticed that all LLaMA-2 7B Chat
model outputs, including the base model outputs, were less informative and less malicious for the
most complex jailbreaking prompts, such as GAME and TOMNJERRY , and more informative and
malicious for easier prompts, such as CHARACTER and KEVIN.
4.3 Full Pruning vs MLP Pruning
LLaMA-2 7B Chat model has 32 Transformer Decoder blocks [ 26]. Each of these decoder blocks
contains linear layers for both the attention mechanism and for the feed-forward network. In this
experiment, we explored the effects of two pruning strategies: pruning every linear layer versus
selectively pruning the layers in the feed-forward networks, which are implemented as multilayer
perceptrons (MLP). Evaluating the jailbreaking resistance for these different strategies revealed a
notable difference, the results of which are displayed in Figure 5. The model pruned to a sparsity
20% across both attention and MLP layers demonstrated increased jailbreaking resistance compared
to selectively pruning the MLP to the same sparsity.

Figure 6 summarizes the results of our pruned LLaMA-2 7B Chat models across various benchmarks.
Table 2 summarizes our findings for Llama-2 Chat model. The corresponding benchmark results for
Vicuna 1.3 and Mistral Instruct v0.2 are provided in the supplementary materials. We observe that
generally, the pruned models perform competitively with and sometimes even surpass the base model.
Since we do not observe significant degradation in the pruned models’ capabilities for reasoning,
context length, or language modeling, the increased jailbreaking resistance from pruning LLaMA-2
and Vicuna cannot be attributed to a decrease in understanding of the task.

5 Attention Pattern Analysis at Inference Time
We analyze attention patterns to aid interpretability[ 23] of our safety results. Specifically, we look at
attention scores from LLaMA-2-7B-Chat at inference time. First, we aim to analyze attention pattern
trends across all evaluation prompts, as well as across different transformer layers and heads. To
achieve this, we have devised several metrics to summarize the sharpness and distribution of attention
patterns. Our focus is specifically on the differences between original task tokens and ‘jailbreak’
tokens. For every token (in every prompt, transformer layer, and attention head), we rank the other
tokens to which it attends and define the following metrics:
8 •IntraTaskRank : The sum of ranks corresponding to attention links between in-malicious-
task tokens.
•EndTaskRank : The sum of ranks corresponding to attention links between the last token in
the sequence and in-malicious-task tokens.
Formally, consider a transformer model with Llayers and Hheads, as well as a jailbreak prompt p
withNptokens. Now, let Tp⊆ {1,2,3, . . . , N p}be the set of indices such that their corresponding
tokens originate from the original malicious task.
For each layer l∈ {1,2,3, . . . , L }, attention head h∈ {1,2,3, . . . , H }, prompt p, and token index
i∈ {1,2,3, . . . , N }we define the list of ranks [r(l,h,p )
i,1, r(l,h,p )
i,2, . . . r(l,h,p )
i,N ]derived by sorting the
ithrow in the attention matrices at layer land head index hwhen processing prompt p. Then,
IntraTaskRank( l, h, p ) =El,h,p
X
i,j∈{1,2,3,...,N p}r(l,h,p )
i,j [i∈T∧j∈T]

EndTaskRank( l, h, p ) =El,h,p
X
i∈{1,2,3,...,N}r(l,h,p )
N,i [i∈T]

Intuitively, the lower the value of either of these metrics, the more invariant transformer models are
to the jailbreak method. Additionally, it is interesting to disentangle whether jailbreak invariance is
more correlated with the way we process malicious task tokens, or more with which tokens receive
the most attention when generating the beginning of a new sequence.

Figure 8: EndTaskRank Difference between Pruned and Base Models.
.
We present our results in Figure 7 and Figure 8 and break down how both metrics differ between base
and pruned models by task severity, task category, and jailbreak method. Across task severity levels
and categories, pruned models consistently process tokens from the original malicious task paying
less attention to the jailbreak pretext than base models do. The higher the target sparsity percentage is,
9 the higher the difference is. We find these metrics’ behavior depends heavily on the jailbreak method,
and in particular on whether or not the original malicious task is appended to the jailbreak pretext or
surrounded by it.
Finally, we focus on the example jailbreak prompt from Table 1. We compare the base and 20%
pruned LLaMA-2-7B-Chat models, specifically examining the attention scores that illustrate how
much the original task tokens attend to each other. For various thresholds, we calculate the number of
scores that exceed each threshold and plot the differences in these counts between the pruned and
base models. This procedure is conducted by aggregating over all attention heads across all layers,
and is also repeated by specifically focusing on attention heads in either the first or the last layer.
(a) All layers.
 (b) First layer.
 (c) Last layer.
Figure 9: Comparing the counts of attention scores above various thresholds in both the base and the
20% pruned LLaMA-2-7B-Chat models reveals that the pruned models pay more attention to other
original task tokens while processing tokens from the original malicious task prompt. The effect
becomes significantly more pronounced in the later layers of the transformer.
.
We present our results in Figure 9 and confirm that the 20% pruned model pays less attention to
jailbreak information in this successful case study.
Overall, we conclude that sharper attention patterns help the model resist jailbreak pretext scenarios.
Pruning linear layers consistently provides safety improvements across a variety of tasks and severity
levels, and they can be explained by numerous metrics that capture model in-variance to jailbreak
token information. Albeit somewhat brittle to original malicious task token location in jailbreak,
our method consistent safety improvements accross a variety of jailbreak methods used in practice.
Additionally, note that this brittleness does not correlate with any decreased performance due to
effects on effective context length, as underscored by our experiments on AltQA.
6 Conclusion
In this work, we explored the effects of pruning on the jailbreaking resistance of large language
models. By applying Wanda pruning at varying levels of sparsity to LLaMA-2-7B-Chat, Vicuna
1.3 and Mistral Instruct v0.2 models, we obtained an assortment of compressed models with which
to compare the susceptibilities of jailbreaking. We further curated a dataset of 225 malicious tasks
and 2250 jailbreaking prompts for a total of 2475 prompts, with which we evaluated our base and
compressed models. Our results show that if the unpruned model is sufficiently safety trained, then
safety improves at lower sparsities of pruning, but then a reversal in the trend when pruned more
aggressively. This suggests the possibility of using a carefully selected amount of pruning to aid in
the deployment of safe LLMs.
For future directions to take with this work, we suggest a more comprehensive analysis of both
base models and compression techniques. We primarily investigated Wanda pruning of 7-billion
parameter models. However, it would be prudent to check whether these trends hold for larger models.
Similarly, we chose this compression technique for its high efficacy and ease of usage, but exploring
other means of compressing would provide a more robust understanding of the effects on safety.
Overall, we have demonstrated that compression can have complicated impacts on the alignment of
LLMs, and with the increasing push for scalable deployment of these models, it becomes all the more
important that these consequences are well understood.

Abstract
The inference process in Large Language Models (LLMs) is often limited due to
the absence of parallelism in the auto-regressive decoding process, resulting in
most operations being restricted by the memory bandwidth of accelerators. While
methods such as speculative decoding have been suggested to address this issue,
their implementation is impeded by the challenges associated with acquiring and
maintaining a separate draft model. In this paper, we present M EDUSA , an ef-
ficient method that augments LLM inference by adding extra decoding heads to
predict multiple subsequent tokens in parallel. Using a tree-based attention mech-
anism , MEDUSA constructs multiple candidate continuations and verifies them si-
multaneously in each decoding step. By leveraging parallel processing, M EDUSA
introduces only minimal overhead in terms of single-step latency while substan-
tially reducing the number of decoding steps required.
We present two levels of fine-tuning procedures for M EDUSA to meet the needs
of different use cases:
• M EDUSA -1: M EDUSA is directly fine-tuned on top of a frozen backbone LLM,
enabling lossless inference acceleration.
• M EDUSA -2: M EDUSA is fine-tuned together with the backbone LLM, enabling
better prediction accuracy of M EDUSA heads and higher speedup but needing a
special training recipe that preserves the backbone model’s capabilities.
Moreover, we propose several extensions that improve or expand the utility of
MEDUSA , including a self-distillation to handle situations where no training data
is available and a typical acceptance scheme to boost the acceptance rate while
maintaining generation quality.
We evaluate M EDUSA on models of various sizes and training procedures. Our
experiments demonstrate that M EDUSA -1 can achieve over 2.2 ×speedup with-
out compromising generation quality, while M EDUSA -2 further improves the
speedup to 2.3-3.6 ×. The code for this implementation is available at https:

2 1 Introduction
The recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated that the quality
of language generation significantly improves with an increase in model size, reaching billions of
parameters [Brown et al., 2020, Chowdhery et al., 2022, Zhang et al., 2022, Hoffmann et al., 2022,
OpenAI, 2023, Google, 2023, Touvron et al., 2023]. However, this growth has led to an increase
ininference latency , which poses a significant challenge in practical applications. From a system
perspective, LLM inference is predominantly memory-bound [Shazeer, 2019, Kim et al., 2023],
with the main latency bottleneck stemming from accelerators’ memory bandwidth rather than arith-
metic computations. This bottleneck is inherent to the sequential nature of auto-regressive decoding,
where each forward pass requires transferring the complete model parameters from High-Bandwidth
Memory (HBM) to the accelerator’s cache. This process, which generates only a single token, un-
derutilizes the arithmetic computation potential of modern accelerators, leading to inefficiency.
To address this, one approach to speed up LLM inference involves increasing the arithmetic intensity
(the ratio of total floating-point operations (FLOPs) to total data movement) of the decoding process
andreducing the number of decoding steps . In line with this idea, speculative decoding has been
proposed [Leviathan et al., 2022, Chen et al., 2023, Xia et al., 2023, Miao et al., 2023]. This method
uses a smaller draft model to generate a sequence of tokens at each step, which is then refined
by the original, larger model for acceptable continuation. However, obtaining an appropriate draft
model remains challenging, and things become even harder when integrating the draft model into a
distributed system [Chen et al., 2023].
Instead of using a separate draft model to sequentially generate candidate outputs, in this paper, we
revisit and refine the concept of using multiple decoding heads on top of the backbone model to
expedite inference [Stern et al., 2018]. We find that when applied effectively, this technique can
overcome the challenges of speculative decoding, allowing for seamless integration into existing
LLM systems. Specifically, we introduce M EDUSA , a method that enhances LLM inference by
integrating additional decoding heads capable of concurrently predicting multiple tokens. These
heads are fine-tuned in a parameter-efficient manner and can be added to any existing model. With
no requirement for a new model, M EDUSA offers easy and automatic integration into current LLM
systems, including those in distributed environments, ensuring a user-friendly experience.
We further enhance M EDUSA with two key insights. Firstly, the current approach of generating
a single candidate continuation at each decoding step leads to a restricted acceptance length and
inefficient use of computational resources. To address this, we propose generating multiple can-
didate continuations using the M EDUSA heads and verifying them concurrently through a simple
adjustment to the attention mask. Secondly, we can use the rejection sampling scheme similar to
that used in speculative decoding to generate responses with the same distribution as the original
model, but it is usually unnecessary for many LLM applications. Alternatively, we also introduce a
typical acceptance scheme that selects reasonable candidates from the M EDUSA head outputs. We
use temperature as a threshold to manage deviation from the original model’s predictions, providing
an efficient alternative to the rejection sampling method. This approach effectively addresses its
limitations, such as decreased speed at higher temperatures.
To equip LLMs with predictive M EDUSA heads, we propose two distinct fine-tuning procedures tai-
lored to various scenarios. For situations with limited computational resources or when the objective To equip LLMs with predictive M EDUSA heads, we propose two distinct fine-tuning procedures tai-
lored to various scenarios. For situations with limited computational resources or when the objective
is to incorporate M EDUSA into an existing model without affecting its performance, we recommend
MEDUSA -1. This method requires minimal memory and can be further optimized with quantization
techniques akin to those in QLoRA [Dettmers et al., 2023], without compromising the generation
quality due to the fixed backbone model. However, in M EDUSA -1, the full potential of the backbone
model is not utilized. We can further fine-tune it to enhance the prediction accuracy of M EDUSA
heads, which can directly lead to a greater speedup. Therefore, we introduce M EDUSA -2, which
is suitable for scenarios with ample computational resources or for direct Supervised Fine-Tuning
(SFT) from a base model. The key to M EDUSA -2 is a training protocol that enables joint training of
the M EDUSA heads and the backbone model without compromising the model’s next-token predic-
tion capability and output quality. We propose different strategies for obtaining the training datasets
depending on the model’s training recipe and dataset availability. When the model is fine-tuned on
a public dataset, it can be directly used for M EDUSA . If the dataset is unavailable or the model
underwent a Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) [Ouyang et al., 2022] process,
we suggest a self-distillation approach to generate a training dataset for the M EDUSA heads.
3 Our experiments primarily focus on scenarios with a batch size of one, which is representative
of the use case where LLMs are locally hosted for personal use2We test M EDUSA on models
of varying sizes and training settings, including Vicuna-7B, 13B (trained with a public dataset),
Vicuna-33B [Chiang et al., 2023] (trained with a private dataset3), and Zephyr-7B (trained with both
supervised fine-tuning and alignment). M EDUSA can achieve a speedup of 2.3 to 3.6 times across
different prompt types without compromising on the quality of generation.

Figure 1: Overview of M EDUSA .MEDUSA introduces multiple heads on top of the last hidden
states of the LLM, enabling the prediction of several subsequent tokens in parallel (Section 3.1.1).
For training M EDUSA heads, the original model is either frozen (MEDUSA -1, Section 3.2.1) or
trained together (M EDUSA -2, Section 3.2.2) with M EDUSA heads. During inference, each head
generates multiple top predictions for its designated position. These predictions are assembled into
candidates, which are subsequently processed in parallel using a tree-based attention mechanism
(Section 3.1.2). The final step is to verify the candidates and accept a continuation. Besides the
standard rejection sampling scheme, a typical acceptance scheme (Section 3.3.1) can also be used
here to select reasonable continuations, and the longest accepted candidate prefix will be used for
the next decoding phase. The efficiency of the decoding process is enhanced by accepting more
tokens simultaneously, thus reducing the number of required decoding steps.

2.1 LLM Inference Acceleration
The inefficiency of Large Language Model (LLM) inference is primarily attributed to the memory-
bound nature of the auto-regressive decoding process. Several methods have been proposed to alle-
viate this issue, improving inference latency and throughput. Traditionally, batch inference has been
2It’s important to note that while M EDUSA can be seamlessly used in a batched inference setting, it requires
additional engineering efforts to integrate into a serving engine like vLLM [Kwon et al., 2023]. We are working
on this and also welcome community contributions to help us.
3Upon contacting the authors, this version is experimental and used some different data than Vicuna 7B and
13B.
4 employed as a straightforward method to enhance arithmetic intensity and escape memory-bound
limitations. However, with LLMs, both model parameters and the Key-Value (KV) cache consume
substantial accelerator memory, hindering the utilization of large batch sizes. Existing methods to
tackle this problem can be conceptually divided into two main categories: (1) Reducing memory
consumption, thereby minimizing memory transfer overhead and enabling larger batch sizes, and
(2) Minimizing the number of decoding steps to decrease latency directly.
Reducing KV Cache. Methods such as Multi-query attention [Shazeer, 2019] and Grouped-query
attention [Ainslie et al., 2023] adopt a direct approach to diminish the KV cache. By utilizing fewer
key and value heads in the attention modules relative to query heads, these strategies substantially
cut the KV’s memory consumption, thereby facilitating larger batch sizes and enhanced accelera-
tor utilization [Pope et al., 2022]. Additionally, Zhang et al. [2023] proposes to selectively retain
the most critical KV tokens, further reducing the KV cache. From a system perspective, Kwon
et al. [2023] introduces a paged memory management scheme for reducing fragmentation of the KV
cache.
Quantization. Quantization techniques are extensively used to shrink LLMs’ memory consump-
tion. Xiao et al. [2023a] apply rescaling between activations and parameters to eliminate outliers
and simplify the quantization process. Dettmers et al. [2022] breaks down matrix multiplications
into predominantly 8-bit and a minority of 16-bit operations. Frantar et al. [2022] iteratively round
weight columns into 3/4 bits, while Lin et al. [2023] present an activation-aware quantization scheme
to protect salient weights and compress LLMs to 3/4 bits. Kim et al. [2023] introduce a sparse plus
low-precision pattern to handle a minor portion of vital weights, among other techniques.
Speculative Decoding. As an approach orthogonal to the aforementioned methods, speculative
decoding [Leviathan et al., 2022, Chen et al., 2023] aims to execute several decoding steps in paral-
lel, thus reducing the total number of steps required. This parallelization is realized by employing a
smaller draft model to conjecture several subsequent words, which the LLMs then collectively evalu-
ate and accept as appropriate. While resonating with non-autoregressive generation literature [Xiao
et al., 2023b], this method is specifically tailored for LLMs to address the aforementioned ineffi-
ciency. Unlike previous works, we propose leveraging the original model to make predictions rather
than introducing an additional draft model. This approach is more straightforward and seamlessly
integrates into existing systems without the complexities of managing two models. Independently,
Miao et al. [2023], Spector and Re [2023] propose the use of tree-structured attention to generate
multiple candidates in parallel, where Miao et al. [2023] suggest employing an ensemble of models
to propose candidates, and Spector and Re [2023] advocate adding another hierarchy for the draft
model. After the first release of M EDUSA , we have seen many new works improving speculative
decoding from the perspective of distillation [Liu et al., 2023, Zhou et al., 2023], making draft model
training-free [He et al., 2023, Fu et al., 2023].
2.2 Sampling Scheme
The manner in which text is sampled from Large Language Models (LLMs) can significantly influ-
ence the quality of the generated output. Recent studies have revealed that direct sampling from a
language model may lead to incoherent or nonsensical results [Pillutla et al., 2021, Holtzman et al.,
2020]. In response to this challenge, truncation sampling schemes have been introduced [Fan et al.,
2018, Basu et al., 2021, Meister et al., 2022, Hewitt et al., 2022, Meister et al., 2023]. These ap-
proaches aim to produce high-quality and diverse samples by performing sampling on a truncated 2018, Basu et al., 2021, Meister et al., 2022, Hewitt et al., 2022, Meister et al., 2023]. These ap-
proaches aim to produce high-quality and diverse samples by performing sampling on a truncated
distribution over a specific allowed set at each decoding step.
Different strategies define this allowed set in various ways. For example, top- ksampling [Fan et al.,
2018] retains the kmost likely words, whereas top- psampling [Holtzman et al., 2020] incorporates
the minimal set of words that account for ppercent of the probability. Another method, known as
typical decoding [Meister et al., 2023], employs the entropy of the predicted distribution to establish
the threshold for inclusion. Hewitt et al. [2022] offers a unified framework to understand truncation
sampling techniques comprehensively.
Drawing inspiration from these methods, our typical acceptance scheme aligns with the concept of
defining an allowed set to exclude improbable candidates from the sampling process. However, we
diverge because we do not insist on an exact correspondence between the output and language model
5 distribution. This deviation allows us to facilitate more diverse yet high-quality outputs, achieving
greater efficiency without compromising the integrity of the generated text.
3 M EDUSA
MEDUSA follows the same framework as speculative decoding, where each decoding step primarily
consists of three substeps: (1) generating candidates, (2) processing candidates, and (3) accepting
candidates. For M EDUSA , (1) is achieved by M EDUSA heads, (2) is realized by tree attention, and
since M EDUSA heads are on top of the original model, the logits calculated in (2) can be used
for substep (1) for the next decoding step. The final step (3) can be realized by either rejection
sampling [Leviathan et al., 2022, Chen et al., 2023] or typical acceptance (Section 3.3.1). The
overall pipeline is illustrated in Figure 1.
In this section, we first introduce the key components of M EDUSA , including M EDUSA heads, and
tree attention. Then, we present two levels of fine-tuning procedures for M EDUSA to meet the needs
of different use cases. Finally, we propose two extensions to M EDUSA , including self-distillation
and typical acceptance, to handle situations where no training data is available for M EDUSA and to
improve the efficiency of the decoding process, respectively.
3.1 Key Components
3.1.1 M EDUSA Heads
In speculative decoding, subsequent tokens are predicted by an auxiliary draft model. This draft
model must be small yet effective enough to generate continuations that the original model will ac-
cept. Fulfilling these requirements is a challenging task, and existing approaches [Spector and Re,
2023, Miao et al., 2023] often resort to separately pre-training a smaller model. This pre-training
process demands substantial additional computational resources. For example, in [Miao et al., 2023],
a reported 275 NVIDIA A100 GPU hours were used. Additionally, separate pre-training can poten-
tially create a distribution shift between the draft model and the original model, leading to continua-
tions that the original model may not favor. Chen et al. [2023] have also highlighted the complexities
of serving multiple models in a distributed environment.
To streamline and democratize the acceleration of LLM inference, we take inspiration from Stern
et al. [2018] and introduce M EDUSA heads. These are additional decoding heads appended to the
last hidden states of the original model. Specifically, given the original model’s last hidden states
htat position t, we add Kdecoding heads to ht. The k-th head is used to predict the token in the
(t+k+1)-th position of the next tokens (the original language model head is used to predict the (t+
1)-th position). The prediction of the k-th head is denoted as p(k)
t, representing a distribution over
the vocabulary, while the prediction of the original model is denoted as p(0)
t. Following the approach
of Stern et al. [2018], we utilize a single layer of feed-forward network with a residual connection
for each head. We find that this simple design is sufficient to achieve satisfactory performance. The
definition of the k-th head is outlined as:
p(k)
t=softmax
W(k)
2·
SiLU (W(k)
1·ht) +ht
,where W(k)
2∈Rd×V, W(k)
1∈Rd×d.
We initialize W(k)
1identically to the original language model head, and W(k)
2to zero. This aligns
the initial prediction of M EDUSA heads with that of the original model. The SiLU activation func-
tion [Elfwing et al., 2017] is employed following the Llama models [Touvron et al., 2023].
Unlike a draft model, M EDUSA heads are trained in conjunction with the original backbone model,
which can remain frozen during training (M EDUSA -1) or be trained together (M EDUSA -2). This
method allows for fine-tuning large models even on a single GPU, taking advantage of the powerful
base model’s learned representations. Furthermore, it ensures that the distribution of the M EDUSA
heads aligns with that of the original model, thereby mitigating the distribution shift problem. Ad- base model’s learned representations. Furthermore, it ensures that the distribution of the M EDUSA
heads aligns with that of the original model, thereby mitigating the distribution shift problem. Ad-
ditionally, since the new heads consist of just a single layer akin to the original language model
head, M EDUSA does not add complexity to the serving system design and is friendly to distributed
settings. We will discuss the training recipe for M EDUSA heads in Section 3.2.
6 3.1.2 Tree Attention
Through M EDUSA heads, we obtain probability predictions for the subsequent K+ 1tokens. These
predictions enable us to create length- K+ 1 continuations as candidates. While the speculative
decoding studies [Leviathan et al., 2022, Chen et al., 2023] suggest sampling a single continuation as
the candidate, leveraging multiple candidates during decoding can enhance the expected acceptance
length within a decoding step. Nevertheless, more candidates can also raise computational demands.
To strike a balance, we employ a tree-structured attention mechanism to process multiple candidates
concurrently. This attention mechanism diverges from the traditional causal attention paradigm.
Figure 2: Tree Attention Illustrated. This visualization demonstrates the use of tree attention
to process multiple candidates concurrently. As exemplified, the top-2 predictions from the first
MEDUSA head and the top-3 from the second result in a total of 2×3 = 6 candidates. Each of these
candidates corresponds to a distinct branch within the tree structure. To guarantee that each token
only accesses its predecessors, we devise an attention mask that exclusively permits attention flow
from the current token back to its antecedent tokens. The positional indices for positional encoding
are adjusted in line with this structure.
Within this framework, only tokens from the same continuation are regarded as historical data.
Drawing inspiration from the concept of embedding graph structures into attention as proposed
in the graph neural network domain [Ying et al., 2021], we incorporate the tree structure into our
attention mask, visualized in Figure 2. For a given k-th head, its top- skpredictions serve as the basis
for candidate formation, where skis a designated hyperparameter. These candidates are established
by determining the Cartesian product of the top- skpredictions from each head. For instance, in
Figure 2, with s1= 2ands2= 3, each first head prediction can be succeeded by any prediction from
the second head. This leads to a tree structure where skbranches exist at the k-th level (considering
a virtual root as the 0-level, in practice, this 0-level is for the prediction of the language model
head of the original model, which can be sampled independently). Within this tree, only a token’s
predecessors are seen as historical context, and our attention mask ensures that the attention is only
applied on a token’s predecessors. By employing this mask and properly setting the positional
indices for positional encoding, we can process numerous candidates simultaneously without the
need to expand the batch size. The cumulative number of new tokens is calculated asPK
k=1Qk
i=1si.
In this section, we demonstrate the most simple and regular way to construct the tree structure
by taking the Cartesian product. However, it is possible to construct the tree structure in a more
sophisticated way and exploit the unbalanced accuracy of different top predictions of different heads.
We will discuss this in Section 3.3.3.
7 3.2 Training Strategies
At the most basic level, we can train M EDUSA heads by freezing the backbone model and focusing
solely on the M EDUSA heads. This approach is straightforward and requires minimal computational
resources. However, training the backbone in conjunction with the M EDUSA heads can significantly
enhance the accuracy of the M EDUSA heads. Depending on the computational resources and the
specific requirements of the use case, we propose two levels of training strategies for M EDUSA
heads.
In this section, we assume the availability of a training dataset that aligns with the target model’s
output distribution. This could be the dataset used for Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) of the target
model. We will discuss how to eliminate the need for such a dataset using a self-distillation approach
in Section 3.3.2.
3.2.1 M EDUSA -1: Frozen Backbone
To train M EDUSA heads with a frozen backbone model, we can use the cross-entropy loss between
the prediction of M EDUSA heads and the ground truth. Specifically, given the ground truth token
yt+k+1at position t+k+ 1, the loss for the k-th head is Lk=−logp(k)
t(yt+k+1)where p(k)
t(y)
denotes the probability of token ypredicted by the k-th head. We also observe that Lkis larger
when kis larger, which is reasonable since the prediction of the k-th head is more uncertain when k
is larger. Therefore, we can add a weight λktoLkto balance the loss of different heads. And the
total M EDUSA loss is:
LMEDUSA -1=KX
k=1−λklogp(k)
t(yt+k+1). (1)
In practice, we set λkas the k-th power of a constant like 0.8. Since we only use the backbone model
for providing the hidden states, we can use a quantized version of the backbone model to reduce the
memory consumption. This introduces a more democratized way to accelerate LLM inference, as
with the quantization, M EDUSA can be trained for a large model on a single consumer GPU similar
to QLoRA [Dettmers et al., 2023]. The training only takes a few hours (e.g., 5 hours for M EDUSA -1
on Vicuna 7B model with a single NVIDIA A100 PCIE GPU to train on 60k ShareGPT samples).
3.2.2 M EDUSA -2: Joint Training
To further improve the accuracy of M EDUSA heads, we can train M EDUSA heads together with the
backbone model. However, this requires a special training recipe to preserve the backbone model’s
next-token prediction capability and output quality. To achieve this, we propose three strategies:
•Combined loss : To keep the backbone model’s next-token prediction capability, we need to add
the cross-entropy loss of the backbone model LLM=−logp(0)
t(yt+1)to the M EDUSA loss.
We also add a weight λ0to balance the loss of the backbone model and the M EDUSA heads.
Therefore, the total loss is:
LMEDUSA -2=LLM+λ0LMEDUSA -1. (2)
•Differential learning rates : Since the backbone model is already well-trained and the M EDUSA
heads need more training, we can use separate learning rates for them to enable faster convergence
of M EDUSA heads while preserving the backbone model’s capability.
•Heads warmup : Noticing that at the beginning of training, the M EDUSA heads have a large loss,
which leads to a large gradient and may distort the backbone model’s parameters. Following the
idea from Kumar et al. [2022], we can employ a two-stage training process. In the first stage, we
only train the backbone model as M EDUSA -1. In the second stage, we train the backbone model
and M EDUSA heads together with a warmup strategy. Specifically, we first train the backbone
model for a few epochs, then train the M EDUSA heads together with the backbone model. Besides
this simple strategy, we can also use a more sophisticated warmup strategy by gradually increasing
the weight λ0of the backbone model’s loss. We find both strategies work well in practice.
Putting these strategies together, we can train M EDUSA heads together with the backbone model
without hurting the backbone model’s capability. Moreover, this recipe can be applied together with Putting these strategies together, we can train M EDUSA heads together with the backbone model
without hurting the backbone model’s capability. Moreover, this recipe can be applied together with
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), enabling us to get a model with native M EDUSA support.
8 3.3 Extensions
3.3.1 Typical Acceptance
In speculative decoding papers [Leviathan et al., 2022, Chen et al., 2023], authors employ rejection
sampling to yield diverse outputs that align with the distribution of the original model. However,
subsequent implementations [Joao Gante, 2023, Spector and Re, 2023] reveal that this sampling
strategy results in diminished efficiency as the sampling temperature increases. Intuitively, this can
be comprehended in the extreme instance where the draft model is the same as the original one. Here,
when using greedy decoding, all output of the draft model will be accepted, therefore maximizing
the efficiency. Conversely, rejection sampling introduces extra overhead, as the draft model and the
original model are sampled independently. Even if their distributions align perfectly, the output of
the draft model may still be rejected.
However, in real-world scenarios, sampling from language models is often employed to generate
diverse responses, and the temperature parameter is used merely to modulate the “creativity” of the
response. Therefore, higher temperatures should result in more opportunities for the original model
to accept the draft model’s output. We ascertain that it is typically unnecessary to match the distri-
bution of the original model. Thus, we propose employing a typical acceptance scheme to select
plausible candidates rather than using rejection sampling. This approach draws inspiration from
truncation sampling studies [Hewitt et al., 2022] (refer to Section 2 for an in-depth explanation).
Our objective is to choose candidates that are typical , meaning they are not exceedingly improbable
to be produced by the original model. We use the prediction probability from the original model as
a natural gauge for this and establish a threshold based on the prediction distribution to determine
acceptance. Specifically, given x1, x2,···, xnas context, when evaluating the candidate sequence
(xn+1, xn+2,···, xn+T+1)(composed by top predictions of the original language model head and
MEDUSA heads), we consider the condition
poriginal (xn+k|x1, x2,···, xn+k−1)>min ( ϵ, δexp (−H(poriginal (·|x1, x2,···, xn+k−1)))),
where H(·)denotes the entropy function, and ϵ, δare hyperparameters. This criterion is adapted
from Hewitt et al. [2022] and rests on two observations: (1) tokens with relatively high probabil-
ity are meaningful, and (2) when the distribution’s entropy is high, various continuations may be
deemed reasonable. During decoding, every candidate is evaluated using this criterion, and a prefix
of the candidate is accepted if it satisfies the condition. To guarantee the generation of at least one
token at each step, we apply greedy decoding for the first token and unconditionally accept it while
employing typical acceptance for subsequent tokens. The final prediction for the current step is
determined by the longest accepted prefix among all candidates.
Examining this scheme leads to several insights. Firstly, when the temperature is set to 0, it reverts
to greedy decoding, as only the most probable token possesses non-zero probability. As the temper-
ature surpasses 0, the outcome of greedy decoding will consistently be accepted with appropriate
ϵ, δ, since those tokens have the maximum probability, yielding maximal speedup. Likewise, in gen-
eral scenarios, an increased temperature will correspondingly result in longer accepted sequences,
as corroborated by our experimental findings.
3.3.2 Self-Distillation
In Section 3.2, we assume the existence of a training dataset that matches the target model’s output
distribution. However, this is not always the case. For example, the model owners may only release
the model without the training data, or the model may have gone through a Reinforcement Learning
with Human Feedback (RLHF) procedure, which makes the output distribution of the model differ- the model without the training data, or the model may have gone through a Reinforcement Learning
with Human Feedback (RLHF) procedure, which makes the output distribution of the model differ-
ent from the training dataset. To tackle this issue, we propose an automated self-distillation pipeline
to use the model itself to generate the training dataset for M EDUSA heads, which matches the output
distribution of the model.
The dataset generation process is straightforward. We first take a public seed dataset from a domain
similar to the target model; for example, using the ShareGPT [ShareGPT, 2023] dataset for chat
models. Then, we simply take the prompts from the dataset and ask the model to reply to the
prompts. In order to obtain multi-turn conversation samples, we can sequentially feed the prompts
from the seed dataset to the model. Or, for models like Zephyr 7B [Tunstall et al., 2023], which are
trained on both roles of the conversation, they have the ability to self-talk, and we can simply feed
the first prompt and let the model generate multiple rounds of conversation.
9 For M EDUSA -1, this dataset is sufficient for training M EDUSA heads. However, for M EDUSA -2, we
observe that solely using this dataset for training the backbone and M EDUSA heads usually leads
to a lower generation quality. In fact, even without training M EDUSA heads, training the backbone
model with this dataset will lead to performance degradation. This suggests that we also need to use
the original model’s probability prediction instead of using the ground truth token as the label for the
backbone model, similar to classic knowledge distillation works [Kim and Rush, 2016]. Concretely,
the loss for the backbone model is:
LLM-distill =KL(p(0)
original ,t||p(0)
t),
where p(0)
original ,tdenotes the probability distribution of the original model’s prediction at position t.
However, naively, to obtain the original model’s probability prediction, we need to maintain two
models during training, increasing the memory requirements. To further alleviate this issue, we
propose a simple yet effective way to exploit the self-distillation setup. We can use a parameter-
efficient adapter like LoRA [Hu et al., 2021] for fine-tuning the backbone model. In this way, the
original model is simply the model with the adapter turned off. Therefore, the distillation does not
require additional memory consumption. Together, this self-distillation pipeline can be used to train
MEDUSA -2 without hurting the backbone model’s capability and introduce almost no additional
memory consumption. Lastly, one tip about using self-distillation is that it is preferable to use
LoRA without quantization in this case, otherwise, the teacher model will be the quantized model,
which may lead to a lower generation quality.

which indicates 4 M EDUSA heads involved in calculation. Each node indicates a token from a top-k
prediction of a M EDUSA head, and the edges show the connections between them. The red lines
highlight the path that correctly predicts the future tokens.
3.3.3 Searching for the Optimized Tree Construction
In Section 3.1.2, we present the simplest way to construct the tree structure by taking the Cartesian
product. However, with a fixed number of total nodes in the tree, a regular tree structure may not be
the best choice. Intuitively, those candidates composed of the top predictions of different heads may
have different accuracies. Therefore, we can leverage an estimation of the accuracy to construct the
tree structure.
Specifically, we can use a calibration dataset and calculate the accuracies of the top predictions of
different heads. Let a(i)
kdenote the accuracy of the i-th top prediction of the k-th head. Assuming
the accuracies are independent, we can estimate the accuracy of a candidate sequence composed
by the top [i1, i2,···, ik]predictions of different heads asQk
j=1a(ij)
j. Let Idenote the set of all
possible combinations of [i1, i2,···, ik]and each element of Ican be mapped to a node of the tree
10 (not only leaf nodes but all nodes are included). Then, the expectation of the acceptance length of a
candidate sequence is:
X
[i1,i2,···,ik]∈IkY
j=1a(ij)
j.
Thinking about building a tree by adding nodes one by one, the contribution of a new node to the
expectation is exactly the accuracy associated with the node. Therefore, we can greedily add nodes
to the tree by choosing the node that is connected to the current tree and has the highest accuracy.
This process can be repeated until the total number of nodes reaches the desired number. In this
way, we can construct a tree structure that maximizes the expectation of the acceptance length.
Fig. 3 illustrates the structure of a sparsely constructed tree for the M EDUSA -2 Vicuna-7B model.
This tree structure extends four levels deep, indicating the engagement of four M EDUSA heads in
the computation. The tree is initially formed through a Cartesian product approach and subsequently
refined by pruning based on the statistical expectations of the top-k predictions from each M EDUSA
head measured on the Alpaca-eval dataset Dubois et al. [2023]. The tree’s lean towards the left
visually represents the algorithm’s preference for nodes with higher probabilities on each head.
4 Experiments
In this section, we present two sets of experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of M EDUSA
under different settings. First, we evaluate M EDUSA on the Vicuna-7B and 13B models [Chiang
et al., 2023] to show the performance of M EDUSA -1 and M EDUSA -2. Second, we evaluate M EDUSA
on the Vicuna-33B and Zephyr-7B [Tunstall et al., 2023] models to study the effectiveness of self-
distillation because for Vicuna-33B model, the training dataset is not publicly available, and for
Zephyr-7B model, the model is trained with RLHF.
We clarify three commonly used terms: a) Acceleration rate: This refers to the average number of
tokens decoded per decoding step. In a standard auto-regressive model, this rate is 1.0. b) Overhead:
This is used to characterize the per decoding step overhead compared to classic decoding, and is
calculated by dividing the average per step latency of the M EDUSA models by that of the vanilla
model. c) Speedup: This refers to the wall-time acceleration rate. Following these definitions, we
have the relation: Speedup = Acceleration rate / Overhead.
4.0.1 Shared Settings
For all the experiments, we use the Axolotl [Axolotl, 2023] framework for training. We use a cosine
learning rate scheduler with warmup and use 8-bit AdamW [Dettmers et al., 2021] optimizer. We
train 5MEDUSA heads with 1layer and set λkin Eq. (1) to be 0.8k. For M EDUSA -2, we use either
LoRA [Hu et al., 2021] or QLoRA [Dettmers et al., 2023] for fine-tuning and set the learning rate
of M EDUSA heads to be 4times larger than the backbone model. LoRA is applied to all the linear
layers of the backbone model, including the language model head. The rank of LoRA adapter is set
to32, and αis set to 16. A dropout of 0.05is added to the LoRA adapter.
4.1 Case Study: M EDUSA -1 v.s. M EDUSA -2 on Vicuna 7B and 13B
4.1.1 Experimental Setup
We use the Vicuna model class [Chiang et al., 2023], which encompasses chat models of varying
sizes (7B, 13B, 33B) that are fine-tuned from the Llama model [Touvron et al., 2023]. Among them,
the 7B and 13B models are trained on the ShareGPT [ShareGPT, 2023] dataset, while the 33B model
is an experimental model and is trained on a private dataset. In this section, we use the ShareGPT
dataset to train the M EDUSA heads on the 7B and 13B models for 2epochs. We use the v1.5 version
of Vicuna models, which are fine-tuned from Llama-2 models with sequence length 4096. We use
a global batch size of 64and a peak learning rate of 5e−4for the backbone and 2e−3for M EDUSA
heads and warmup for 40steps. We use 4-bit quantized backbone models for both models. We first
train the models with M EDUSA -1 and use these trained models as initialization to train M EDUSA -2. heads and warmup for 40steps. We use 4-bit quantized backbone models for both models. We first
train the models with M EDUSA -1 and use these trained models as initialization to train M EDUSA -2.
We employ QLoRA for M EDUSA -2 and the λ0in Eq. (2) is set to be 0.2.

4.1.2 Results
We collect the results and show them in Fig. 4. The baseline is the vanilla Huggingface implemen-
tation. In Fig. 4a, we can see that for the 7B models, M EDUSA -1 and M EDUSA -2 configurations
lead to a significant increase in speed, measuring in tokens processed per second. M EDUSA -1 shows
a 2.18×speedup, while M EDUSA -2 further improves this to a 2.83 ×. When applied to the larger
13B model, M EDUSA -1 results in a 2.33 ×speed increase, while M EDUSA -2 maintains a similar
performance gain of 2.83 ×over the baseline. We also plot the speedup per category for M EDUSA -2
Vicuna-7B model. We observe that the “Coding” category benefits from a 3.29 ×speedup, suggest-
ing that M EDUSA is particularly effective for tasks in this domain. This points to a significant po-
tential for optimizing coding LLMs, widely used in software development and other programming-
related tasks. The “Extraction” category shows the highest speedup at 3.62 ×, indicating that this
task is highly optimized by the M EDUSA . Overall, the results suggest that the M EDUSA significantly
enhances inference speed across different model sizes and tasks.
4.2 Case Study: Training with Self-Distillation on Vicuna-33B and Zephyr-7B
4.2.1 Experimental Setup
In this case study, we focus on the cases where self-distillation is needed. We use the Vicuna-33B
model [Chiang et al., 2023] and the Zephyr-7B model [Tunstall et al., 2023] as examples. Following
the procedure described in Section 3.3.2, we first generate the datasets with some seed prompts. We
use ShareGPT [ShareGPT, 2023] and UltraChat [Ding et al., 2023] as the seed datasets and collect
a dataset at about 100ksamples for both cases. Interestingly, we find that the Zephyr model can
continue to generate multiple rounds of conversation with a single prompt, which makes it easy
to collect a large dataset. For Vicuna-33B, we generate the multi-turn conversations by iteratively
feeding the prompts from each multi-turn seed conversation. Both models are trained with sequence
length 2048 and batch size 128. We use M EDUSA -2 for both models and instead of using a two-stage
training procedure, we use a sine schedule for the θ0to gradually increase the value to its peak at the
end of the training, we find this approach is equally effective. We set the peak learning rate of the
backbone LoRA adapter to be 1e−4and the warmup steps to be 20. Since the self-distillation loss is
relatively small, we set the λ0in Eq. (2) to be 0.01.
4.2.2 Results
Table 1 complements these findings by comparing various M EDUSA -2 models in terms of their
acceleration rate, overhead, and quality on MT-Bench. Notably, while the M EDUSA -2 Vicuna-33B
12 model shows a lower acceleration rate, it maintains a comparable quality. We hypothesize that this
is due to a mismatch between the hidden training dataset and the dataset we used for self-distillation.
These results underscore the complex interplay between speed and performance when scaling up
model sizes and applying self-distillation techniques. The findings also highlight the potential of the
MEDUSA -2 configuration to boost efficiency in processing while carefully preserving the quality
of the model’s outputs, suggesting a promising direction for co-optimizing LLMs with M EDUSA
heads.

4.3 Ablation Study
4.3.1 Configuration of Tree Attention
The ablation study of tree attention is conducted on the writing and roleplay categories from the MT-
Bench dataset [Zheng et al., 2023] using M EDUSA -2 Vicuna-7B. We target to depict tree attention’s
motivation and its performance.
Fig. 6a compares the acceleration rate of randomly sampled dense tree configurations (Section. 3.1.2,
depicted by blue dots) against optimized sparse tree settings (Section. 3.3.3, shown with red stars).
The sparse tree configuration with 64 nodes shows a better acceleration rate than the dense tree
settings with 256 nodes. Fig. 6b presents the speed for both dense and sparse tree settings. The
trend observed here indicates a notable decrease in speed as the additional length increases. This
suggests that while sparse tree attention is beneficial for maintaining a steady acceleration rate, it
comes with the trade-off of reduced speed, particularly at higher additional lengths.
The observed decline in speed is attributed to the increased overhead introduced by the hardware
architecture. While a more complex tree can improve the acceleration rate, it does so at the cost of
speed due to the hardware-imposed overhead.

4.3.2 Thresholds of Typical Acceptance
The thresholds of typical acceptance are studied on the “Writing” and “Roleplay” categories from
the MT-Bench dataset [Zheng et al., 2023] using M EDUSA -2 Vicuna 7B. Utilizing the Vicuna 7B
model, we aligned our methodology with the approach delineated by Hewitt et al. [2022] setting the
α=√ϵ. Fig. 7 presents a comparative analysis of our model’s performance across various sampling
settings. These settings range from a threshold ϵstarting at 0.01 and incrementally increasing to 0.25
in steps of 0.01. Our observations indicate a discernible trade-off: as ϵincreases, there is an elevation
in quality at the expense of a reduced acceleration rate. Furthermore, for tasks demanding creativity,
it is noted that the default random sampling surpasses greedy sampling in performance, and the
proposed typical sampling is comparable with random sampling when ϵincreases.

model in Table 2. We provided the comparison of directly fine-tuning the model with the M EDUSA
heads vs. M EDUSA -2 that involves two-stage fine-tuning described in Section 3.2.2. The findings
indicate that implementing our M EDUSA -2 for fine-tuning maintains the model’s quality and con-
currently improves the speedup versus M EDUSA -1.
4.4 Discussion
In conclusion, we have proposed M EDUSA , a novel method to accelerate large language model in-
ference by equipping models with additional predictive decoding heads. M EDUSA allows models
to generate multiple tokens per step, overcoming the bottleneck of sequential auto-regressive de-
coding. We have demonstrated two procedures, M EDUSA -1 and M EDUSA -2, for efficiently training
these extra heads while preserving model performance. Experiments on models of varying sizes and
training methods show consistent speedups of 2.3-3.6 ×on single prompt inference across different
prompt types and models.
Key advantages of M EDUSA include its simplicity, parameter efficiency, and ease of integration into
existing systems. By building on top of speculative decoding concepts, M EDUSA avoids the need for
specialized draft models. The typical acceptance scheme also removes complications from rejection
sampling while still providing reasonable outputs. Finally, the fine-tuning procedures ensure high-
quality generations without affecting the performance of the original model.

Abstract —Online hate speech proliferation has created a diffi-
cult problem for social media platforms. A particular challenge
relates to the use of coded language by groups interested in both
creating a sense of belonging for its users and evading detection.
Coded language evolves quickly and its use varies over time.
This paper proposes a methodology for detecting emerging coded
hate-laden terminology. The methodology is tested in the context
of online antisemitic discourse. The approach considers posts
scraped from social media platforms, often used by extremist
users. The posts are scraped using seed expressions related
to previously known discourse of hatred towards Jews. The
method begins by identifying the expressions most representative
of each post and calculating their frequency in the whole
corpus. It filters out grammatically incoherent expressions as
well as previously encountered ones so as to focus on emergent
well-formed terminology. This is followed by an assessment of
semantic similarity to known antisemitic terminology using a
fine-tuned large language model, and subsequent filtering out
of the expressions that are too distant from known expressions
of hatred. Emergent antisemitic expressions containing terms
clearly relating to Jewish topics are then removed to return only
coded expressions of hatred.
Index Terms —hate speech, coded antisemitic terminology
I. I NTRODUCTION
Online hate speech detection1is a complex problem for
social media platforms. A particular challenge, not much
discussed in the literature, relates to the use of coded language.
The following post illustrates the issue in the context of
antisemitic hate speech:
“Nope Globalist want us intertwined and run by the
elites, Globalist don’t lay tariffs on their friends you
stupid fu****”. [posted on Dec. 31, 2022, on the
Disqus platform ]
According to the American Jewish Committee (AJC) Translate
Hate Glossary2, aglobalist , in its unbiased definition, is
“a person who advocates the interpretation or planning of
economic and foreign policy in relation to events and devel-
opments throughout the world”. According to this definition,
the term is rather flattering. Indeed, that is the way it is
intended in the Hyatt hotel’s welcoming message to its club
members seen in Figure 13. In that commercial context a
Research supported by American University’s Signature Research Initiative
program. We thank Jacob Levine for his inspiration in the initial steps of this
project.

3Photo by one of the authors on 11/3/23 at a Hyatt Texas property.
Fig. 1. Non antisemitic use of the term ”globalist”
globalist refers to someone “who gets it!” and should feel
good about it! The term does not, in any way, refer to Jews.
Yet, the AJC Translate Hate Glossary argues that the term
has an antisemitic connotation when it “is used to promote
the antisemitic conspiracy that Jewish people do not have
allegiance to their countries of origin, like the United States,
but to some worldwide order—like a global economy or
international political system—that will enhance their control
over the world’s banks, governments, and media”. In the above
post, it is clear that the antisemitic connotation is implied.
From this post, we surmise that
1) The globalists (a.k.a., the Jews) are distinct from “us”,
presumably, the good American citizens;
2) They control “our” fate to be run by the elites (a subset
of these Jews)4;
3) They help each other by not imposing the same tariffs presumably, the good American citizens;
2) They control “our” fate to be run by the elites (a subset
of these Jews)4;
3) They help each other by not imposing the same tariffs
on each other as those they impose on “us”.
The above post, thus has a double meaning. To a recipient
who is unaware of its antisemitic connotation, some category
of people, the globalists , do not seem to behave very nicely.
Yet, to an informed audience, it is a very pointed post that
reiterates old Nazi and Soviet anitisemitic propaganda5and
propagates it further. Furthermore, on social media platforms,
4“Elite” appears in the AJC Glossary in the context of “Cosmpolitan Elite”:
““Cosmopolitan” and “elite” are terms that have separately incited antisemites
across the political spectrum. Based on stereotypes of Jewish wealth and
insularity, Jews have been accused of being part of an elite class for centuries.”
5c.f. “Globalist” and “Cosmopolitan Elite” in the AJC Glossary.arXiv:2401.10841v1  [cs.CL]  19 Jan 2024 it does so without setting off any serious alerts since, except
for the “stupid fu****” mention, which could raise a flag, no
offensive terms are used.
Though the usefulness and importance of catching such
subtle posts and their impact on society beyond the small
extremist groups they are primarily intended for are important
subjects that we debate elsewhere, this paper is concerned with
the automatic discovery of “coded” terms similar to globalists
andcosmopolitan elite which carry both a “regular” and an
antisemitic connotation depending on the context in which they
are used. Such an automated process is necessary due to the
fact that coded terminology evolves rapidly online and fixed
glossaries such as the AJC glossary become quickly outdated.
In addition, due to the large volume of posts appearing on
social media, human monitoring cannot be performed without
the assistance of automated tools pointing them in the right
direction. The purpose of our approach is just that: to create an
automated monitoring tool to assist human monitors by sug-
gesting emerging, potentially coded, antisemitic terminology,
along with the posts that use that terminology.
Though the topic of hate speech is, unfortunately, quite vast,
this study focuses on antisemitism. The choice of a particular
category of hate speech comes from our belief that we can
perform a more thorough analysis of the problem by remaining
focused. Antisemitism was selected because of the reported
increase in antisemitic incidents in the months preceding the
beginning of this study, in 2022. The lessons learned from
this particular study will apply to other categories of hatred
including hatred against Black, Muslim, Asian, and LGPTQ+
populations amongst others.
The main contribution of this paper is a methodology
for the novel problem of extracting emerging coded hate-
laden terminology (antisemitism, in this paper) from extremist
social posts, along with a practical pipeline to demonstrate
its effectiveness. The methodology is based on the hypothesis
thatcoded antisemitic terminology begets coded antisemitic
terminology. In other words, those who use coded termi-
nology to remain under the radar of social media monitors
will, when not able to express new ideas with existing coded
terms, derive or invent new ones. Based on this hypothesis, we
harvest terminology used in similar contexts as known coded
antisemitic terminology and propose it as potential emerging
antisemitic coded terminology to human monitors, along with
the context in which that terminology occurs. We propose
four different versions of our pipeline and validate them using
a quantitative approach. The most advanced version is also
evaluated qualitatively. We conclude with a discussion of our
approach’s practical utility.
The remainder of the paper is structured as follows: Section
II presents background and related work. In Section III, we
discuss data preparation matters. Next, the methodology and
pipeline for extracting coded terminology is introduced in
detail in Section IV. This is followed by a presentation and
discussion of the results in Section V. Finally, Section VI
concludes the paper and discusses future work.II. B ACKGROUND AND RELATED WORK
With the advent of the internet and social media, technology
has increased the speed at which language evolves. Propaganda
in the form of hate speech now travels the world at such a fast
pace that it is beyond human capacity to keep up with. Harmful
words take on new meanings in both direct and coded ways,
inciting hatred in the minds of those only too willing to believe
them as they reinforce and justify preexisting prejudices.
A. Machine Learning Methods for Hate Speech Detection
In recent times, there has been a notable rise in hate
crimes across the United States.6While establishing a clear
relationship between hate crimes and online content is not
straightforward, a report by the US Department of Justice crimes across the United States.6While establishing a clear
relationship between hate crimes and online content is not
straightforward, a report by the US Department of Justice
points to the simultaneous purchases of Facebook ads contain-
ing dividing content and hate crime. These two reports7thus
suggest that hate speech should not be considered harmless,
and coming up with methods to curb it is an important goal.
Previous work aims to detect hate speech from social media
using various Machine Learning (ML) methods as documented
by a number of surveys written in the last six years [1]–[4].
One of the most recent surveys shows that while up to 2016,
fewer than 10 papers were published on the topic each year,
since then, there has been a huge increase in interest in the
topic with over 150 papers published in 2020, the last year
for which their survey had complete information [4]. Hate
speech detection has been attempted using a wide variety of
techniques and applied to many different problems. Founta et
al. [5], for example, used Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) to
classify racism and sexism. Serr `a et al. [6] showed that charac-
ter level based Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTMs)
for abusive language detection could be useful. Similarly,
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have also been shown
to be successful in hate speech detection and classification
[7]. More recently, large language models have been used for
these tasks like in the work of [8] who propose different fine-
tuned and non-fined-tuned variations of pre-trained models
such as BERT, RoBERTa, ALBERT, etc. on offensive language
detection. Most of these studies, however, consider hate speech
as a whole and, typically, do not distinguish the community
towards which it is directed. We feel that this generalized
approach is too broad and decided, instead, to use a divide-
and-conquer approach by focusing on particular communities
separately. Our first attempt focused on the Jewish community
and the problem of antisemitic speech in social media.
B. Antisemitism in Social Media and its Detection
Antisemitism specifically targets Jewish individuals or the
Jewish community [9]. In [10], authors use the outcomes of
two surveys from EU and ADL to assess how the level of
antisemitism relates to the perception of antisemitism by the
Jewish community in eight different EU countries. A recent
6https://bjs.ojp.gov/library/publications/hate-crime-recorded-law-enforcement-2010-2019
7(1) https://bit.ly/2xeeF5h; (2) https://www.ojp.gov/pdffiles1/nij/grants/
304532.pdf survey finds that 20% of American Jewish adults have expe-
rienced an act of antisemitism, such as an attack either online
or on social media.8In another study, the authors address the
challenges of quantifying and measuring online antisemitism.
It raises the question of whether the number of antisemitic
messages is increasing proportionally to other content or if the
share of antisemitic content is rising. Additionally, the paper
aims to determine the extent of online Jew-hatred beyond well-
known websites, forums, and closed social media groups [11].9
A few studies have attempted to combat online antisemitism
in a way similar to the way in which generalized hate speech
has been countered in the works discussed in the previous
section. In [12], for example, the authors prepared a data
set that includes both social posts and associated images,
when available. They labeled the entries as antisemitic or
not, and if antisemitic, indicated the kind of antisemitism:
political, economic, religious or racial. They used a bimodal
deep learning approach for classifying the data into these
categories. [13] considers a subset of the text-only part of
this datasetin an attempt to classify antisemitic posts using a
less computationally-intensive approach. Focusing on the class
imbalance problem in the data while taking advantage of Ope-
nAI’s GPT technology, they compared GPT-based resampling
techniques against other traditional kinds. Very recently, [14]
proposed a new data set for antisemitism detection in social
media posts that uses a strict annotating process. The data
set is so recent, however, that it has not yet been used for
classification or the results obtained on such efforts have not
yet been published. There are other projects that consider the
detection of online antisemitism using AI approaches as well.
In particular, the project entitled “Decoding Antisemitism”10
calls itself an “AI-driven Study on Hate Speech and Imagery
Online”, and already produced five published reports on the
subject. The project specifically aims at linking national or
international events reported in the traditional media to anti-
semitic online social media discussions.
C. Alternatives to automated hate speech detection
In [15], the authors question whether the way in which hate
speech detection has been handled by the machine learning
community is the way forward, or whether hate speech detec-
tion is a lot more complex than previously assumed by the
researchers who labeled data sets and applied classifiers to
them. Furthermore, the authors note that some hateful content
may occur without the use of well-known slurs and that on
top of it all, the nature of hate speech is constantly evolving.
In contrast to previous studies, our work takes these observa-
tions into consideration and focuses on identifying emerging,
potentially coded terms related to antisemitism using NLP
methods. There has been a lack of rigorous research in finding
emerging antisemitic coded terms that can lead to the detection
of hate speech and, perhaps, subsequently, to the prevention of
hate crimes. This paper aims to bridge this gap and provide an

III. D ATA PREPARATION
This study is part of a large multi-disciplinary project
sponsored by our institution which, simultaneously, collects
and analyzes the use of coded language to express antisemitic This study is part of a large multi-disciplinary project
sponsored by our institution which, simultaneously, collects
and analyzes the use of coded language to express antisemitic
sentiment in lightly moderated social media platforms typi-
cally preferred by individuals with extremist tendencies and
studies the migration of this language from these extremist
platforms to the general population. The overall project in-
cludes a data team, a population team, and a software team
which collaborate closely and work in parallel. The pipeline
illustrating our proposed methodology is shown in Figure 2.
A. Dataset
The project is constantly evolving, though for this study,
we considered the first delivery of the data curated by the
data team in June 2023. The data team’s objectives concerning
this study was to analyze the usage of antisemitic terms.
We describe the data gathering and cleanup methodologies
summarized by the 3 leftmost components in Figure 2.
1) Data Scraping and Labeling: To build the corpus, the
data team analyzed antisemitic social media posts from various
extremist social media platforms including Discuss, Telegram,
Minds, and GETTR. It used antisemitic expressions obtained
from the previously mentioned American Jewish Commit-
tee (AJC) Translate Hate Glossary as well as the Southern
Poverty Law Center (SPLC) to collect social media posts.
This collection effort was facilitated by Pyrra11, a private
software company that allows its users to scrape posts from
alt-social media platforms according to a list of seed terms.
The data team considered the 46 seed expressions available
from the AJC Glossary at the time as well as the term “Cultural
Marxism”, discussed in a SPLC article12and chose 16 of them
to make the process tractable. It analyzed the 659 retrieved

cultural-marxism-catching the post was antisemitic or not.13The 16 terms used in the
subset were selected based on their potential to reveal posts
that had emerging new antisemitic terms in them. The list
of seed words used is: Cabal, Cosmopolitan Elite, Cultural
Marxism, Deicide, The Goyim Know, Holocough, Jewish Cap-
italist, Jewish Communist, Jew Down, Jewish Lobby, New
World Order, Not the Real Jews, Rothschild, Soros, Zionist,
andZionist Occupied Government . Since the distribution of
posts with respect to each seed expression is not ideal, though
the software team used all the posts retrieved from the 16
seed expressions, it used only the seed expressions with at
least 5 posts related to them to conduct its analysis. The terms
dropped from the list according to this criterion are Jew Down
andCosmopolitan elite , leaving us with 14 seed words for the
remainder of the study.
2) Preprocessing: Text preprocessing is a critical step in
Natural Language Processing (NLP). It involves transforming
raw text data into a format that can be easily analyzed by
machine learning algorithms. The preprocessing steps usually
used involve several techniques, such as tokenization, stop
word removal, stemming, and lemmatization [16]. During the
first phase of cleaning the corpus, we removed the urls
and lower-cased all the posts to normalize them. This initial
procedure was followed by stop words removal. Then we
lemmatized the text to get a single root form for each word
prior to passing it on to the coded antisemitic terms extraction
process, which will be discussed in the next section. Bigrams
and trigrams were formed by running two- and three- word
windows through all the posts.14It was important to filter
out badly-formed expressions obtained through that approach.
In particular, we decided to include bigrams and trigrams
that only contain nouns, proper nouns, adjectives, and verbs,
since others were judged less relevant to our quest.Since the
emphasis of this study is on the novel proposed extraction
process discussed next, we did not experiment with the various
pre-processing techniques suggested in the literature on hate
speech for social media posts [17]. It was left for future work.
IV. C ODED ANTISEMITIC TERMS EXTRACTION APPROACH
As previously mentioned, the purpose of this study is the
extraction of emerging coded antisemitic terms . In order to
carry out this goal, we designed a method for operationalizing
each term of that expression. That operationalization and the
linking of its resulting components into a functional system
constitute the main contribution of this work. The purpose
of this section is to discuss the process. To begin with, we
consider each word in the emerging coded antisemitic terms
expression and give it the specific meaning shown below.
•Terms: the extracted expressions are limited to grammat-
ically consistent bigrams and trigrams; they have to be
relevant enough to the documents in which they appear
and appear frequently enough in the corpus.
13A copy of the coding statement is available upon request.
14We also considered unigrams but were not able to filter them effectively
using our current methodology. Their treatment was left for future work.•Antisemitic: the candidate expressions have to be se-
mantically related to antisemitic discourse.
•Coded: antisemitic expressions that contain terms relat-
ing to obvious Jewish concepts are removed.
•Emerging: already known coded antisemitic expressions
are removed in order to concentrate on new terminology.
These operations are divided into two phases. In Phase 1, we
address the extraction of emerging coded terminology without
worrying about its semantic relation to antisemitism. In Phase
2, we address semantics using large language models. Phase 1
is represented by the “Important Terms Extraction” component
in Figure 2. Phase 2 is represented by the combination of the
LLM Generation, Similarity Scoring, Antisemitic Terminology
Extraction, and Monitoring components in Figure 2. Both in Figure 2. Phase 2 is represented by the combination of the
LLM Generation, Similarity Scoring, Antisemitic Terminology
Extraction, and Monitoring components in Figure 2. Both
phases of the pipeline are implemented using two approaches:
a standard solution and an advanced solution. We subse-
quently test all four combinations, yielding a baseline approach
composed of two standard solutions, two hybrid approaches
composed of one standard and one advanced solution, and
one advanced approach composed of two advanced solutions.
A. Phase 1: Emerging Coded Trending Terms Extraction
For the first part of Phase 1, the extraction of trending terms,
we explore the use of off-the-shelf NLP tools for our standard
solution and then propose our advanced solution that combines
tf-idf and frequency. Once the trending terms are extracted, we
propose a strategy to remove non-emerging and non-coded
terms from the list of extracted terms. This strategy is applied
to both the standard and advanced solutions.
1) Standard Solution: Trending Terms Extraction using
Concordance and Collocation tools: In this first attempt at
trending terms extraction, we use traditional NLP techniques to
extract bi-grams and tri-grams using concordance and colloca-
tion algorithms from the NLTK Toolkit [18]. Concordance is a
technique that provides a comprehensive view of how a given
term appears in a corpus. Using this approach, we use the
14 seed terms from Section III-A1 for analyzing patterns and
gaining insights into language usage. For each occurrence of a
seed term, this approach provides the surrounding words con-
text. We use default settings for the extraction of context. Next,
using collocation, we find the most frequent bi-grams and tri-
grams in the collected contexts. Collocation is a technique that
finds a meaningful combination of words from a corpus that
are semantically coherent. Different statistical measures can
be used to detect collocations including frequency, pointwise
mutual information (PMI), and log-likelihood ratio (LLR)
among others. We use frequency, here since that is the measure
also used in the advanced approach In the future, we plan to
experiment with other statistical measures for both approaches.
The standard approach yielded 126 trending terms.
2) Advanced Solution: Trending Terms Extraction using
TF-IDF and Frequency: Our proposed advanced approach
is presented in Algorithm 1 which uses TF-IDF feature-
weighting [19] and frequency to extract trending terms. In a
nutshell, this was done by selecting all the terms that obtained
a TF-IDF value greater than a self-set threshold, listing these terms in decreasing order of frequency, and selecting the top
200 terms from the list.15When the same term appeared in
several documents, the highest TF-IDF value it received was
retained Algorithms 1 shows the approach that was followed
in detail. The algorithm is explained line by line next.
Algorithm 1 Trending terms extraction

2:Initialize Ds▷Stores terms’ highest TF-IDF scores (s)
3:Initialize Df ▷Stores terms’ values and frequencies

ument and store them in matrix W∈Rd×v, where

vocabulary size.

value and frequency in Df
17: i = i + 1

19:end for
20:SortDfin descending order of frequency
21:fori= 1,2, . . . , 200 do
22: Trending terms ←Df[i][T] ▷Store the most
frequent terms in Trending terms (drop the frequencies)
23:end for
The algorithm begins by initializing the
Trending_terms list which is the list that will return the
200 bigrams and trigrams (terms) that received the highest
combination of TF-IDF and Frequency scores. Next, Ds
andDfare also initialized. Dswill be used to store all the
terms’ highest TF-IDF scores, whereas Dfwill store all
the terms and their associated frequencies. Since terms are
subsequently referred to according to their indices, T, which
is set next, serves as the reference vector that associates
an index with the actual value of the term (i.e., the actual
bigram or trigram). Next, the frequency of each term in
the corpus is calculated and saved in vector F. The TF-IDF
values obtained for each unique term and each document are
then calculated and placed in the matrix Wof size d x v
where drepresents the number of documents whereas, vis
the number of terms.
15We assume that at least 200 terms had a TF-IDF value larger than the
self-set threshold.On lines 7-11, we take each term in matrix Wand find the
highest score across all the rows (documents) of the matrix
and store it in Ds. To remove the less relevant terms, we
compute the average of all the values in Dsand use this value,
δ, as a threshold. This allows us to consider only the terms
with TF-IDF values greater than the average value of all the
scores in Ds.δis calculated on line 12. On lines 13-19, we
check if the terms’ TF-IDF value is greater than δ. If so, we
save the terms’ values and their frequencies in Df. Finally, on
line 20, we sort the terms in Dfin descending order of their
frequency values and select the top 200 terms, storing them
inTrending_terms .
3) Removal Strategy : Redundant, Non-Emergent and Non-
Coded terms Removal: Once the list of most trending terms
have been extracted using either the standard or advanced
solution, three categories of terms are removed from it. First,
as we consider expressions that are both bigrams and tri-
grams, there is a possibility of encountering bigrams within
trigrams. Such redundant bigrams are removed from the list
of expressions. Next, we remove the terms that have occurred
earlier. For now, this corresponds to the original list of 16
seed words used to retrieve the posts. In the future, this list
will grow as we intend to use the system continuously, using
newly discovered terms of interest as new seed terms. Lastly,
the terms that are considered non-coded are removed. These
correspond to terms that contain words that obviously pertain
to Jewish themes. The list of words currently used includes the terms that are considered non-coded are removed. These
correspond to terms that contain words that obviously pertain
to Jewish themes. The list of words currently used includes
jew, jewish, kike, and zionist. Expressions that include these
words either as stand-alone words or embedded within other
words are removed. After the removal phase is applied, we
are left with 52 and 94 trending terms for the standard and
advanced trending term extraction solutions, respectively.
B. Phase 2: Embeddings and Comparisons
Though the bigrams and trigrams extracted in the previous
section are known to be trending, their semantics are unknown
and, in particular, there is no information as to whether or
not these terms are antisemitic. To find out which of these
trending expressions are antisemitic, we compare the context
in which they are used to the context in which the known
antisemitic expressions are used. If a trending term appears
in contexts similar to those in which seed expressions occur,
it will be deemed antisemitic. Otherwise, it will be discarded
as non-antisemitic. To compute embeddings for the trending
and seed terms, we begin by fine-tuning BERT. Since BERT
was not specifically trained on instances of hate speech or
antisemitism, we fined-tuned it with additional data collected
using the same seed expressions as before (since time elapsed
between the original collection and the new collection, more
posts were available for this exercise). This fine-tuned version
of BERT is then used to generate contextual embeddings for
both the trending terms discovered in the last section and the
seed terms used to extract posts. We present the details of
BERT’s fine-tuning followed by the standard and advanced
embedding solutions we implemented. T erm W ordContext words in window of size 5

1) Fine-tuning the BERT model: The generalized BERT
model does not possess domain-specific vocabulary, thus it
is not capable of handling coded hate speech such as anti-
semitism. Indeed, when such out-of-vocabulary terms occur,
they get broken down into smaller tokens for which embed-
dings are generated. These are treated as rare tokens, yielding
unsatisfactory results. To avoid this issue, we fine-tune the
BERT model using an additional 56K posts extracted using
the same seed words as before on Pyrra. We, thus, extend
BERT’s vocabulary from 30k to 55k tokens, and fine-tune
it using the Masked Language Modeling (MLM) approach.
MLM is a pre-training approach that masks a few tokens. The
model is subsequently trained to predict the masked tokens
from the words that surround them.16
2) Comparing Trending Terms to Seed Terms: To differ-
entiate between antisemitic and non-antisemitic terms during
Phase 2, we compare the trending terms’ embeddings to the
seed terms’ embeddings using Cosine Similarity. We generate
two types of embeddings following i) the standard pre-truncate
embedding method and ii) the advanced post-truncate embed-
ding method. In pre-truncate embedding, we truncate the post
containing the term to be embedded prior to embedding it. In
post-truncate embedding, we embed the entire post containing
the term of interest, and truncate the resulting embedding
afterwards .17
a) Standard Solution: Pre-truncate embeddings: In this
approach, we consider context windows of 5 to 14 words,
where the size of the windows refers to the twin windows
located before and after the term being embedded, respectively.
We show an example of windows of size 5 in Figure 3.
Since the same term may be found in more than one post,
we concatenate all the embeddings extracted from fine-tuned
BERT using the same window size and take their average.
Embedding, here, refers to the pooled layer obtained
from the 12 layers of the BERT architecture. We follow the
same procedure for all the trending terms we extracted and
the 14 seed words retained in Section III-A1.
Next, we determine the trending terms antisemitic nature
using Algorithm 2. After some initialisations on lines 1-4,
S[tt], the “similarity to antisemitism” value for trending term
tt, is computed as follows: tt’s embedding is compared to
each of the 14 seed terms (the st’s)’s embeddings using Cosine
16https://huggingface.co/learn/nlp-course/chapter7/3
17Since we cannot embed posts exceeding 512 tokens, we turned large posts
into multiple ones.Similarity as described on lines 6-8. On line 9, the 14 resulting
measurements are averaged and assigned to S[tt]The process
is repeated for each trending term (lines 5-10) and the median
of all the S[tt]’s,γ, is calculated on line 11. γis then used
as our threshold for potential antisemitism on lines 12-18: if
S[tt]for trending term ttis greater than γ,ttwill be given
the partial label “potentially antisemitic” ( TTPLw[tt]=
1). Otherwise, it will be given the partial label “probably
not antisemitic” ( TTPLw[tt]= 0). (We used the median
as it offered more flexibility than the mean.) Algorithm 2 is
repeated 10 times, once for each window size wconsidered.
This yields 10 partial labels TTPLw[tt],w= 1. . .10for
each term tt, and the final labeling for ttis “antisemitic” if
mout of the 10 partial labels are “potentially antisemitic”. It
is “not antisemitic”, otherwise. The optimal value of mwas
7 for the pre-truncate case.

b) Advanced Solution: Post-truncate embeddings: In
this approach, we begin by embedding each complete post
using fine-tuned BERT. The approach is illustrated in Figure
4 for the 18-word post AND THE EVIL LYING DEEP

x12x768 tensor representing the total number of words
in the post, the total number of encoding layers, and their
dimension. This embedding can be thought of as a word
embeddings lookup table that provides complete context for
each post.18Once this embedding is constructed, we follow

the same procedure described in Section IV-B2a except for the
fact that we now extract word-level contextual embeddings
from the lookup table (see Figure 4). The advantage of
this approach over the previous one is that it builds more
informed embeddings given its use of a complete rather than
partial context. Please note that there are three additional
differences between the standard and the advanced approach:
in the standard approach, we used context window sizes
between 5 and 14 while in the advanced approach, we used
context window sizes between 1 and 10. That is because a
window of 1 word does not convey much information in the
standard approach whereas it does in the advanced approach.
As a result, we started at size 5 in the standard approach and
1 in the advanced approach and used 10 different window
sizes in each case. Furthermore, in the advanced approach,
the embeddings are generated by averaging the final encoder
layer of BERT rather than using the pooled layer since that
yielded better results. Finally, the optimal value for min the
advanced approach was 9 rather than 7.
V. R ESULTS AND DISCUSSION
The purpose of our study was to design a methodology
for extracting emerging coded antisemitic terminology from
online posts appearing on social media platforms often used
by extremist groups. We proposed a pipeline to implement this
methodology and instantiated this pipeline with standard and
advanced components. The difficult part of our evaluation is
the assessment of whether the approach yields a significant
number of terms and whether these terms can, indeed in some
contexts, have an antisemitic connotation. In order to answer
these questions, we created a gold standard and tested our
results according to it.
A. Construction of a gold standard:
The gold standard we created uses two complementary
methodologies. One for the terms already familiar to the
community that fights antisemitism, and the other, for theterms unknown or not yet catalogued by that community.19
Known Terms For the first category, we simply compiled
a general glossary from three existing sources: the Institute
for Curriculum Services’ Glossary spanning the history of
European Antisemitism, which we took in its entirety; the
American Jewish Committee “Translate Hate” glossary which
we also used in its entirety (prior to its recent expansion from
46 to 70 terms) and portions of the Glossary of Terms and
Acronyms constructed by the R2Pris project on Radicalization
and violent extremism. Since this last source encompassed ha-
tred of different types, for this specific study, we restricted our-
selves to the terms whose composition or definition included
a known antisemitic term (e.g., nazi, Aryan, anti-semitic, Ku
Klux Klan, SS, Swastika, Fascism, White Supremacist, etc.).20
New Terms The new terms are the terms that do not appear in
the glossaries just mentioned and that need to be manually
verified through an internet search. We used the following
systematic procedure to assign ground labels to new terms:
•Each extracted term not found in the glossary compilation
was searched for on Google in two ways: the term alone
or together with “+ antisemitism” added to the search.
•The documents retrieved on the first page of the Google
browser for both searches were examined for references
to antisemitism.
•If, based on this analysis, the term was found to be
associated with antisemitism (e.g., “deep state” was found
to be associated with a conspiracy theory against the
Jews), it was coded as antisemitic in our gold standard associated with antisemitism (e.g., “deep state” was found
to be associated with a conspiracy theory against the
Jews), it was coded as antisemitic in our gold standard
database. If, on the other hand, the term did not carry any
clear meaning (e.g., “late 20th”) or was not associated
with antisemitism (e.g., “new york city”), it was coded
as not antisemitic in our gold standard database.
Qualitative evaluation We conducted two types of qualitative
evaluation. The first one simply consisted of observing the
terms extracted by the approach to assess whether they made
sense when taken out of context. The second one can be
thought of as a sanity check. For terms extracted and labeled
as either antisemitic or not, we went back to the the posts
from which the term was extracted to assess whether, within
the context of the post, it was used in an antisemitic way or
not. Though we do not use these qualitative assessments in
our quantitative evaluation, we show examples of the different
situations that arose in terms of agreement or disagreement
between our system and our gold standard.
B. Results
Quantitative Results: We tested four different versions of
our proposed pipeline, by combining the standard and ad-
19In this paper, we created a prototype system based on the seed words
provided to us by the data team. These seed words are only a small subset of
the already known coded antisemitic terms. As a result, some of the emergent
terms discovered by our system are emergent vis-a-vis the system’s knowledge
but not vis-a-vis the broader current knowledge. Discovering terms known
to the community but not known by the system constitutes a useful proof
of concept. The discovery of terms not currently known by the community
constitutes an added demonstration of the worth of the approach.

vanced solutions proposed for trending term extraction with
the standard and advanced solutions proposed for term em-
bedding. These combinations resulted in one standard, two
hybrid, and one advanced implementation. Table I lists the
results obtained by concordance + collocation followed by
pre-truncation embedding (colloc-pretrunc) or post-truncation
embedding (colloc-posttrunc); and those obtained by tfidf
+ frequency followed by pre-truncation embedding (tfidf-
pretrunc) or post-truncation embedding (tfidf-posttrunc). The
results were obtained using our gold standard labels. The
approach using the two advanced components stands out as
the absolute winner: tfidf-posttrunc, although the results for
all four methods, including tfidf-posttrunc, show a higher level
of recall than precision. Future work will attempt to improve
all these metrics scores, with a focus on precision so as
not to unduly label terms as antisemitic when they are, in
fact, benign. When comparing the numbers in Table I, it is
important to note that the number and type of terms retrieved
differ between the two term extraction processes, colloc and
tfidf. While colloc extracted 52 terms of which only 7 were
truly antisemitic, tfidf extracted 94 of which 29 were truly
antisemitic. The recall of 1 obtained by the two colloc-based
methods, thus means that both pretrunc and posttrunc were
able to identify these 7 antisemitic terms. Their low level of
precision, however, suggests that they are too liberal in their
labeling of terms as antisemitic.
Qualitative Results: Our qualitative evaluation was applied
to the version of our pipeline that obtained the best results:
tfidf-posttrunc, i.e., the advanced version. Table II shows some
of the terms extracted by that version. The terms in red
correspond to terms incorrectly classified as antisemitic with
no good explanation; those in black are correctly classified as
antisemitic as they correspond to our Known Terms ; those in
blue were verified to be antisemitic as they correspond to our
New Terms ; and those in purple were incorrectly classified as
antisemitic, although the context in which they arise is clearly
antisemitic. As discussed below, we call these terms Neutral
(in an antisemitic context) .
Sanity Check: In Table III, we show a few sample posts con-
taining the following trending antisemitic terms discovered by
tfifd-posttrunc: Interest groups ,White Genocide ,
Deep state . Each of these terms had an entry in the
antisemitic glossary compilation described earlier. For in-
stance, White Genocide , refers to a conspiracy theory
rooted in white supremacist ideology, claiming that there is
an intentional effort by Jews to destroy the white race through
immigration, mixed-racial marriage, LGBTQ+ identification,etc. Table III also shows an instance of a new term —
FEMA camps . This corresponds to a conspiracy theory where
FEMA is believed to plan the incarceration and possible
execution of US citizens in favor of the establishment of a
New World Order, one of our seed words which often refers
to the establishment of a new form of government controlled
by a Jewish elite.On the other hand, during the process of
extracting coded antisemitic terms, some terms were labeled
as antisemitic despite the fact that they do not appear in our
gold standard. In certain cases, that represents an outright
mistake like in the case of Big Part in Table III where
the context is certainly racist, but not specifically antisemitic,
though antisemitism is part of the post, but in other situations,
a case could be made for the antisemitic label. For example, the context is certainly racist, but not specifically antisemitic,
though antisemitism is part of the post, but in other situations,
a case could be made for the antisemitic label. For example,
our approach predicts End game as a coded antisemitic term,
even though we did not find any reason for it in our glossary or
internet search. A look at the post in which the term appeared
(Table III) helps us understand how the antisemitic context of
the post that includes the terms “concentration camps” and
”new world order” led the system to mislabel it. We conclude
that, in such cases, our approach is extracting the right term
according to the context, but the term should be considered
Neutral (in an antisemitic context) rather than antisemitic.
C. Discussion
Though we assume that our approach could still be refined,
we note that the results obtained by the most successful version
of our system are encouraging, suggesting the viability of our
hypothesis that emergent coded terms could be discovered
automatically using distance measures in embedding spaces.
The sanity checks suggest that the terms identified by our
approach are, usually, warranted as the context shown in the
posts attests to the antisemitic nature of the way in which
the identified terms are used. These checks also point to
the errors made by the system and will help us improve
our results. We also believe that our approach could have
important practical uses. After being vetted by a human team,
the emergent coded terminology it discovers could be input
to the moderating algorithms used by social media platforms
to discover problematic discourse or users currently avoiding
discovery.
VI. C ONCLUSION
This paper proposes an approach for detecting the emer-
gence of new antisemitic coded terminology which offers
a valuable resource in combating online antisemitism and
contributes to the ongoing efforts to create safer and more
inclusive online spaces. We achieve an accuracy of 80% and TABLE II

large language model approaches and their various parameter
combinations. Similarly, we will experiment with different
types of text pre-processing approaches to deal specifically
with hate-speech and social media text. This will be done in
the context of a lifelong-learning setting where the trending
terms discovered will be used as input to the data scraping
component in the following iteration. We also intend to create
a more user-friendly version that will be convenient for people
working in this space. Finally, our goal is to extend this study
to hateful terminology against other minority groups.

Abstract
In this study, we investigate the enhancement of
the GPT Neo 125M’s performance in Commu-
nity Question Answering (CQA) with a focus
on programming, through the integration of Re-
inforcement Learning from Human Feedback
(RLHF) and the utilization of scores from Stack
Overflow. Two distinct reward model training
strategies are employed for fine-tuning with
Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). Notably,
the improvements in performance achieved
through this method are comparable to those of
GPT Neo’s 2.7B parameter variant. Addition-
ally, an auxiliary scoring mechanism is intro-
duced, which demonstrates the limitations of
conventional linguistic metrics in evaluating re-
sponses in the programming domain. Through
accurate analysis, this paper looks at the di-
vergence between traditional linguistic met-
rics and our human-preferences-based reward
model, underscoring the imperative for domain-
specific evaluation methods. By elucidating
the complexities involved in applying RLHF to
programming CQA and accentuating the signif-
icance of context-aware evaluation, this study
contributes to the ongoing efforts in refining
Large Language Models through focused hu-
man feedback.
1 Introduction
Advances in Reinforcement Learning from Hu-
man Feedback (RLHF) have revolutionized the
fine-tuning of Large Language Models (LLMs),
facilitating adaptation for human-like response gen-
eration and precise behavior control (Ouyang et al.,
2022). While RLHF has proven effective in gen-
eral domains, its application in specialized fields
such as Community Question Answering (CQA)
for programming remains unexplored (Beeching
et al., 2023). LLMs face unique challenges in han-
dling the complex nature of programming queries,
including conceptual understanding, code genera-
tion, API usage, and debugging, due to struggles
with subtle semantic relations.Furthermore, a critical challenge is the evalua-
tion of the quality of responses generated by LLMs.
Conventional metrics such as BertScore and Rouge
do not capture the essence of responses effectively,
especially in specialized domains like program-
ming (Wang et al., 2019). Moreover, they don’t ac-
count for the diversity in valid answers and lack in
capturing deeper semantic correctness. The devel-
opment of more reliable and context-sensitive eval-
uation metrics is essential(Kovalchuk et al., 2022).
To address these challenges, in this paper, we
investigate the application of RLHF to a smaller
model, GPT Neo 125M (Black et al., 2021a), in the
context of programming CQA. We aim not only to
enhance the model’s response generation capabil-
ities but also to address the evaluation challenge.
Our contributions are two-fold. First, we explore
the potential and efficacy of RLHF in retraining
a smaller LLM for programming CQA. Second,
through empirical analysis, we highlight the dis-
crepancies between the RLHF reward model and
existing linguistic metrics, emphasizing the limita-
tions of current evaluation methodologies and ad-
vocating for the development of more semantically-
sensitive measures.
The structure of the paper is as follows: Section
2 provides background information and describes
the datasets used in this study. In Section 3, we
delve into the application of RLHF for program-
ming CQA, explaining the data preparing method-
ologies employed. Section 4 focuses on the experi-
mental evaluation and results. Section 5 presents a
discussion of the study results and evaluation meth-
ods. Finally, Section 6 concludes the paper with
final remarks and reflections on our findings.

2 Background and Dataset
2.1 Background on RLHF and LLMs
Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback
(RLHF) is a technique where models are trained us-arXiv:2401.10882v1  [cs.CL]  19 Jan 2024 ing human feedback as rewards. This method has
become notably beneficial in refining the perfor-
mance and behavior control of Large Language
Models (LLMs). RLHF initiates with models
trained using supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which
are then iteratively improved. Crucially, the hu-
man scoring process in RLHF is often automated
by training a separate reward model, serving as an
optimization proxy. This process varies in imple-
mentation and warrants further exploration.
The application of RLHF in LLMs has been ex-
plored in various contexts. For instance, Ziegler
et al. (2019) studied the impact of reward learn-
ing on specific tasks, demonstrating the potential
of RLHF in enhancing the performance of LLMs.
The work of Stiennon et al. (2020) and the Ope-
nAI Alignment Team in 2021 further expanded the
scope of RLHF, applying it to the task of summa-
rizing text and books, respectively.
In the context of Question Answering (QA),
RLHF has been used to train models to navigate
the web (Nakano et al., 2021) and to follow instruc-
tions (Ouyang et al., 2022). However, these studies
have mainly focused on general domains or specific
tasks, and the application of RLHF in specialized
fields such as programming Community Question
Answering (CQA) remains largely unexplored.
2.2 Dataset Selection and Preprocessing
In the study, we used Stack Overflow1(SO) as
the primary data source for programming-related
question-answering tasks. We regarded the answers
on SO as reference solutions. We compiled the
dataset from the original data available on Stack Ex-
change2, focusing on questions specifically tagged
with ’python’. This dataset, which includes titles,
questions, answers per question, and user scores
for each, was used for both supervised fine-tuning
and partial reward model training. To ensure the
dataset’s relevance and homogeneity, we subjected
it to a series of constraints and transformations.
Furthermore, we adjusted user ratings for different
reward model training setups.
We applied several constraints to refine the
dataset and maintain consistency:
•We only selected questions classified as “API
Usage” according to the taxonomy by Beyer
et al. (2020). This selection was performed
1https://stackoverflow.com/
2https://stackexchange.com/using regular expressions to ensure alignment
with the study’s focus.
•To maintain text purity and the ability to gen-
erate a response based on the context only, we
filtered out questions and answers containing
images, links, or code blocks, designated by
the <pre><code> HTML tags. Code blocks
were filtered out to prevent the model from
generating code snippets during training, as
this would significantly complicate the eval-
uation process due to the lack of established
metrics for assessing the quality of generated
code.
•HTML content was sanitized and converted
to plain text using the Beautiful Soup3library
to prepare it for natural language processing.
We obtained a dataset of 6,946 training entries
and 1,000 validation entries. To prevent data leak-
age and ensure temporal relevance, the validation
set included questions posted after December 14,
2021.
While this dataset is highly relevant for studying
RLHF in programming CQA, it is worth noting
that the constraints applied may introduce certain
limitations in terms of the diversity of questions
and real-world applicability.
3 RLHF for programming Q&A
The general schema of RLHF utilized in this study
consists of several stages, as depicted in Fig. 1.
The process commences with the training of an ini-
tial policy via supervised learning. Subsequently,
a reward model is trained to acquire human pref-
erences from the labeled data. Finally, the policy
is fine-tuned using Proximal Policy Optimization
(PPO) (Schulman et al., 2017), guided by the re-
ward model.
In this study, we have adapted RLHF for pro-
gramming Q&A by converting user ratings from
Stack Overflow into feedback for training our
model. We used two distinct approaches: creat- ward model.
In this study, we have adapted RLHF for pro-
gramming Q&A by converting user ratings from
Stack Overflow into feedback for training our
model. We used two distinct approaches: creat-
ing regression scores and contrastive scores for the
straightforward comparison of answers. Addition-
ally, to enhance the logical alignment of sentences
and mitigate the model’s errors in generation, we
completed the dataset for reward model training
with generations from the SFT model.

3.1 Transformation of User Ratings
To account for biases arising from factors like the
question’s age and popularity, we preprocess and
normalize user ratings. Our approach comprises
two distinct transformations: Regression Scores
and Contrastive Scores.
Algorithm 1 Regression scores transforming
Input: user votes for each answer N_votes ij
Output: regression scores sij
1:foreach question qido
2: foreach answer ajinqido
3: sij=N_votes ij
N_answers i
4: end for
5:end for
6:l_bound, u _bound = 1.5×IQR(sij)
7:foreach score sijdo
8: ifsijoutside the range [l_bound, u _bound ]
then
9: sij=clip(sij,−1,1)
10: else
11: sij=max _abs_scale (sij, sign (sij))
12: end if
13:end for
14:return sijfor all i, j
3.1.1 Regression Scores
For regression scores, user ratings were normalized
by the total number of answers for each question.
After clipping outliers, the ratings were scaled tocontrol the standard deviation, thus stabilizing the
regression training. The process is outlined in Al-
gorithm 1. There vijrepresents the votes for each
answer ajin question qiandsijfor the regression
scores.
3.1.2 Contrastive Scores
Contrastive scores allow a convenient comparison
of answer ratings by mapping them to logarithmi-
cally scaled scores (Askell et al., 2021). Accepted
answers receive an additional increment, while neg-
ative ratings are assigned a standard value. The
following Algorithm 2 details this process:
In this algorithm, vjdenotes the votes for each
answer, and the contrastive scores, sj, are com-
puted using a logarithmic scale.
Additionally, we first identified questions with
more than one answer after preprocessing and fil-
tering, which amounted to 3,076. We compared
each of these answers with the highest-voted an-
swer for each question during the training of the
reward model. After this comparison, the contrast
dataset contained 1,804 rows.
3.2 Data Generation for Reward Model
Training
We generated 6,872 additional answers for ques-
tions with only one answer to create a comparison
set essential for training the reward model. This
step was undertaken to ensure a diverse dataset that
simulates various answer qualities.
For the regression approach, we assigned Algorithm 2 Contrastive scores scaling
Input: votes for each answer vj
Output: contrastive scores sij
1:foreach answer ajdo
2: ifvj<0then
3: sj=−1
4: else
5: sj=⌈log2(1 +vj)⌉
6: ifajis accepted then
7: sj=sj+ 1

16: end for

these generated answers a normal distribution
N(−0.5,0.12). This was based on the observation
that most generated answers were either completely
uninformative or erroneous. We believe that dis-
couraging the generation of nonsensical answers is
a helpful practice.
In the contrastive approach, these generated an-
swers were incorporated into the contrast dataset,
which previously only included questions with
more than one existing answer.
The generation of this additional data was cru-
cial for robustly training the reward model. In the
experimental section, we will delve into how this
dataset was leveraged to train the reward model ef-
fectively, and the evaluation metrics used to assess
its performance.
4 Experimental evaluation
This section aims to evaluate the effectiveness of
the RLHF training approach for improving the
quality of generated responses in the programming
QA domain. Specifically, we compare three ver-
sions of the model, according to Fig. 1 - the base
model, the SFT version, and the RLHF version.
The evaluation focuses on the performance of the
reward model training methods and the generated
responses’ quality.4.1 Evaluation approach
Fig. 2 illustrates the evaluation schema. For each
question in the validation dataset, the model gener-
ates ten responses using sampling-based decoding.
This approach allows us to study the average qual-
ity of the generated responses without bias toward
the worst or best cases. The parameters used for
sampling-based decoding are as follows:
•do_sample : true
•no_repeat_ngram_size : 2
•top_k : 50
•top_p : 0.9
To evaluate the responses’ content and seman-
tic similarity, we employ the SacreBLEU, Rouge,
and BertScore metrics as common metrics for nat-
ural language generation tasks. Additionally, the
reward models rate each generated response as an
alternative quality assessment tool.
For a more insightful evaluation, we also con-
duct a human-based assessment. A subset of 100
randomly selected questions is manually evaluated
by ourselves. Each generated answer for these
questions is inspected and marked as useful (1) or
not useful (0) for solving the problem stated in the
question. This binary labeling enables the compu-
tation of the Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR), which
assesses the relevance of the generated responses.
Finally, to investigate the consistency between
the different metrics and reward model assess-
ments, we employ Spearman’s rank correlation
coefficient. This statistical measure will provide
insight into whether the automatic metrics and the
reward model assessments are aligned in evaluating
response quality.
4.2 Experimental setup
All experiments were conducted using the GPT
Neo model (Black et al., 2021b) with 125 million
parameters, selected based on the constraints dis-
cussed in the corresponding section.
4.2.1 Supervised fine-tuning
Fine-tuning was performed on the training dataset
described in Section 2.2. We utilized the Trans-
formers and PyTorch Lightning libraries with the
following hyperparameters: optimizer = Adam,
Adam betas = (0.9, 0.999), Adam epsilon = 1e-
08, weight decay = 0.001, learning rate = 2e-05, Figure 2: The general schema of evaluation approach
learning rate decay scheme = linear, batch size = 12,
and mixed precision training (fp16). The maximum
length of the concatenated question and answer was
set to 512 tokens. If the input sequence exceeded
this length, the question was truncated, ensuring
that the full answer was available for training.
4.2.2 Reward Model Training
We trained the reward model using two approaches:
regression and answer comparison. The regres-
sion approach employed the Mean Squared Error
(MSE) as the loss function, while the answer com-
parison approach used the Contrastive Loss (see
Formula 1).
L(θ) =−E(x,yj,yk)∼D[log(σ(rθ(x, yj)−rθ(x, yk)))] (1)
where randyare the reward model’s score and
yis the preferred candidate respectively. Both ap-
proaches used the SFT model as the basis.
For the regression approach, the hyperparame-
ters were as follows: optimizer = Adam, Adam
betas = (0.9, 0.999), Adam epsilon = 1e-08, weight
decay = 0.001, learning rate = 2e-05, learning rate
decay scheme = linear, batch size = 16, and mixed
precision training (fp16).
For the contrastive approach, we used the same
hyperparameters with a different learning rate (3e-
05) and batch size (8). Additionally, for both ap-
proaches, the weights of the first and last layers, as
well as all linear layers of the model, were updated
during training.
Both approaches exhibited stability during train-
ing, achieving validation accuracies of 93% and
95% respectively. For the regression approach, ac-
curacy was computed using the formula:
accuracy =1
nX
[sign(ri) =yi] (2)where riandyimean ithreward and target score re-
spectively. Considering both positive and negative
rewards is essential in reinforcement learning.
4.2.3 Fine-tuning with RL
We employed reinforcement learning using the
TRL and Transformers libraries, with typical RLHF
parameters: optimizer = Adam, Adam betas = (0.9,
0.95), Adam epsilon = 1e-08, learning rate = 1.41e-
05, epsilon clip range = 0.2, buffer size = 64, and
batch size = 16. Additionally, we used adaptive KL
control with an initial KL coefficient of 0.2 and a
target of 6.
During reinforcement learning, the training was
stable, and the average reward increased when us-
ing the reward model based on the regression ap-
proach. However, training was unstable and did not
converge using the reward model based on answer
comparisons. Tuning model starts generate repet-
itive words and incoherent sentences. Therefore,
the results section presents the outcomes for the
model trained using the regression-based reward
model.
4.3 Results
This section presents the results of the experiments,
which were conducted to assess the efficacy of the
RLHF training approach in the context of program-
ming QA response generation. We examine the
performance of the different models and discuss
the correlation and consistency between the metrics
employed for evaluating the quality of the gener-
ated responses.
4.3.1 Comparison of Average Metrics
Our evaluation process involved computing the av-
erage metrics for ten generation attempts by four
models: Base GPT Neo 125M (Base 125M), Su-

metric across ten generation attempts.
GPT Neo 2.7B (Base 2.7B). These models evalu-
ated using several metrics, including SacreBLEU,
Rouge 1, Rouge 2 and BertScore, as well as the
scores obtained from the regression and contrastive
reward models.
Table 1 presents the average values of these
metrics for each model. Notably, the RLHF ver-
sion demonstrated superior performance compared
to the SFT model in terms of SacreBLEU and
BertScore. However, the larger Base GPT Neo
2.7B model surpassed the other models in terms
of the Rouge scores. All highlighted metrics were
deemed statistically significant via the KS-test. The
inclusion of bootstrapped confidence intervals fur-
ther clarifies the model’s improvement relative to
the baseline.
4.4 Metrics at Rank k Analysis
Beyond the mean values, we performed an in-
depth analysis using the metric@k approach. The
term “metric at rank k” refers to the highest score
achieved by a metric among k randomly sampled
generation attempts. This analysis helps to re-
veal the capability of the models to generate high-
quality responses within a certain number of at-
tempts.
Fig. 3 illustrates graphs depicting the relation-
ship between the metric values and the number of
generation attempts (k). These graphs provide in-
sights into the performance of the models as the
number of generation attempts increases. Partic-
ularly, after several generation attempts, both the
SFT and RLHF versions appear to outperform the
larger GPT Neo 2.7B model in terms of the eval-
uated metrics. Additionally, the RLHF model ex-
hibits significant improvement in BertScore, which
suggests enhanced semantic similarity between the
generated and reference responses.Table 2 presents the results for Metrics@10,
which indicates the best metric scores among 10
generation attempts. Most of the highlighted values
have been determined to be statistically significant
as per the U-test and KS-test. Interestingly, Base
GPT Neo 2.7B exhibits the highest average model
reward based on the contrastive approach. This
might suggest that the model’s responses are more
diverse and, in some cases, closer to the reference
answers.
The Rouge 2 metric, which focuses on the over-
lap of bigrams between the generated and refer-
ence texts, presents a close competition among the
models. This implies that the inclusion of both con-
tent words and their ordering are well-represented
across models.
4.5 MRR Comparison
An additional analysis conducted to assess the
consistency between reward models and metrics
used for evaluating the quality of the generated re-
sponses. This analysis involved the utilization of
manual annotations for answers corresponding to
100 random questions.
In this analysis, MRR calculated for varying val-
ues of k, where kdenotes the top-ranked answers
accordingly to some metric. The Mean Reciprocal
Rank at k (MRR@k) is a statistical measure for
evaluating any process that produces a list of pos-
sible responses to a sample of queries, ordered by
probability of correctness. If we have Aanswers,
andRiis the rank of the first relevant document

then the MRR@k is:

ing the MRR values when considering the top 10

metrics exhibit higher values, which implies that
they are key metrics in assessing the accuracy of the
generated responses. However, the trained reward
models display superior performance compared to
both the SacreBLEU and BertScore metrics.
4.6 Correlation Analysis
In addition to the previous evaluations, a corre-
lation analysis carried out among the assessment
methods utilized. Specifically, the Spearman cor-
relation coefficient was computed to understand
the relationships between the various metrics. The
Spearman correlation coefficient is a nonparametric
measure that evaluates the strength and direction
of the association between two ranked variables.
Appendix A contains tables that compare the
cross-correlation coefficients of the metrics for
each model generations. Upon examination, a
prominent correlation between the rankings ofRouge 1 and Rouge 2 is evident. Furthermore,
the reward regression model exhibits a moderate
correlation when responses are generated by the
fine-tuned models. Interestingly, BertScore demon-
strates little to no correlation, or even a negative
correlation, with the other metrics. This raises ques-
tions about its reliability as a comparative measure
in this context. Additionally, it is notable that the re-
ward models display minimal correlation amongst
themselves, when trained through different method-
ologies.
5 Discussion
The study focused on the generating QA highlights
the effective implementation of the RLHF in the in-
tricate domain. This method outperforms SFT tech-
nique, marking its superiority in terms of metrics
performance. Moreover, the application of RLHF
has demonstrated that it’s possible to competitively
train smaller models, showcasing its efficacy even
in scenarios with limited resources.
Regarding the scoring parameters, the study
draws attention to the utility of Rouge scores in
gauging response precision. This implies a poten- Base 125M SFT 125M RLHF 125M

tial edge of Rouge over alternative scoring systems
like SacreBLEU and BertScore in certain contexts.
However, there exists ambiguity in the MRR re-
sults for BertScore and SacreBLEU metrics when
juxtaposed with the outcomes from the trained re-
ward models. This raises questions about the ad-
equacy of these metrics for the programming do-
main, which is hallmarked by complex semantic re-
lationships and a plethora of correct answers. This
ambiguity is further cemented by near-zero Spear-
man correlations associated with various linguistic
metrics.
These findings not only provide a deeper under-
standing of RLHF’s potential and boundaries but
also emphasize the necessity for diverse, domain-
specific methods when evaluating generation qual-
ity. In this context, the programming domain serves
as an exemplar. This research’s insights could stim-
ulate further advancements in the development of
novel and more suitable metrics for similar com-
plex domains.
6 Conclusion
In conclusion, our study has demonstrated the
effectiveness of RLHF in enhancing the perfor-
mance of small LLMs like GPT Neo 125M in the
programming domain. Our experiments focused
on fine-tuning the model using user-generated re-
sponses from Stack Overflow, employing two re-
ward model training strategies, regression scores
and contrastive scores, with PPO.
The study also highlights the critical role of
employing the right evaluation measures. While
Rouge scores effectively captured response accu-
racy, other metrics like BertScore and SacreBLEU
presented ambiguities, especially when juxtaposed
with the results from the trained reward models.
This disparity, brought into sharper focus by near-
zero Spearman correlations, implies that traditional
metrics might not suffice for complex fields suchas programming. These domains are marked by in-
tricate semantic relationships and a broad spectrum
of valid answers.
As we look to the future, we envision testing
our methodologies and experiment setups on larger
models to assess the scalability of our approach and
verify the consistency of our results. We anticipate
that these further investigations would provide valu-
able insights into the behavior and performance of
these larger models under RLHF based fine-tuning,
thereby expanding the scope of our current study.
The insights derived from our research enrich
our understanding of both the potential and the
limitations of RLHF. They also underline the ne-
cessity for tailored evaluation methods in complex
domains. As we persist in honing and formulating
innovative techniques for efficient generation, the
lessons gleaned from our work will undoubtedly
prove invaluable.
Limitations
In this study, we attempted to investigate the appli-
cation of the GPT Neo model with 125M parame-
ters in assessing the quality of linguistic metrics in
the Usage API subcategory of question-and-answer
data. We acknowledge several limitations that need
to be taken into account when interpreting the re-
sults.
First, the data used in the experiments is domain-
specific, sourced exclusively from the Usage API
subcategory, which lacks code blocks. Although
our findings demonstrate discrepancies between
linguistic metrics within this chosen domain, their
generalizability to other question-and-answer cat-
egories remains unclear. It’s possible that our re-
ward model may perform differently when applied
to more diverse datasets with varied question types
and content, including those that incorporate code
blocks.
Second, the application of the small GPT Neo model with 125M parameters represents a signif-
icant limitation in terms of both computational
capacity and the model’s semantic understanding.
The constraints of our computing resources, specif-
ically the usage of 2 Nvidia A6000 GPUs and the
necessity to accommodate three models during the
RLHF training, have imposed certain restrictions.
Owing to VRAM limitations, portions of the ques-
tion context were omitted during training, poten-
tially undermining the model’s ability to fully grasp
the semantic relations in the language.
Another caveat concerns the scale of the model.
While our experiments illustrated the small model’s
ability to enhance results to levels comparable to
its larger counterparts, the behavior of the larger
models under similar experimental conditions is yet
to be understood. This question remains open and
warrants further investigation in future research.
In summary, our study provides valuable insights
into the use of smaller GPT Neo models for assess-
ing linguistic metrics, but the highlighted limita-
tions underscore the need for additional research in
broader data contexts, with larger models, and con-
sidering the intricate facets of language translation
and reformulation.

Abstract
With the breakthrough of multi-modal large language
models, answering complex visual questions that demand
advanced reasoning abilities and world knowledge has be-
come a much more important testbed for developing AI
models than ever. However, equipping AI models with ro-
bust cross-modality reasoning ability remains challenging
since the cognition scheme of humans has not been under-
stood systematically. In this paper, we believe that if we
can collect visual clues in the given image as much as pos-
sible, we will recognize the image more accurately, under-
stand the question better, recall relevant knowledge more
easily, and finally reason out the answer. We discover these
rich visual clues by mining question-answer pairs in images
and sending them into multi-modal large language models
as prompts. We call the proposed method Q&A Prompts.
Specifically, we first use the image-answer pairs and the
corresponding questions in the training set as inputs and
outputs to train a visual question generation model. Then,
we use an image tagging model to identify various instances
and send packaged image-tag pairs into the visual question
generation model to generate relevant questions with the
extracted image tags as answers. Finally, we encode these
generated question-answer pairs as prompts with a visual-
aware prompting module and send them into pre-trained
multi-modal large language models to reason out the final
answers. Experimental results show that, compared with
state-of-the-art methods, our Q&A Prompts achieves sub-
stantial improvements on the challenging visual question
answering datasets requiring reasoning over diverse world
knowledge, such as OK-VQA and A-OKVQA.

machine learning community. To solve this Turing test, ar-
tificial intelligence (AI) models are expected to be equipped
with the human capabilities of visual recognition, language
understanding, logical reasoning, world knowledge refer-
ring, etc. There are a variety of datasets focused on dif-
ferent problems in VQA, such as works in [3, 12] stud-
ied the perception and language understanding problem,
works in [21] studied reasoning on procedurally gener-
ated images, and some other works studied structured fac-
tual knowledge [46, 47] or commonsense knowledge [50].
Recently, with the advent of multi-modal large languagearXiv:2401.10712v1  [cs.CV]  19 Jan 2024 models (MLLMs) [6, 24, 28, 49], significant progress has
been achieved in perception-based VQA tasks [3, 12] and
”closed” knowledge-based VQA tasks [46, 47]. Fig. 1 (a)
and Fig. 1 (b) show such VQA tasks, which can be reliably
solved by MLLMs.
However, for more complex VQA tasks [34, 40] as
in Fig. 1 (c) and Fig. 1 (d), that feature the necessity
of diverse world knowledge and complex chains of rea-
soning, state-of-the-art models [13, 18, 27] even MLLM
methods [6, 24] fail to give the correct answers. Differ-
ent from perception-based VQA in [3, 12] and ”closed”
knowledge-based VQA in KB-VQA [46] or FVQA [47],
real-world visual question reasoning in OK-VQA [34] and
A-OKVQA [40], requires not only diverse forms of world
knowledge but also need complex reasoning logic. In Fig. 1
(d), where a woman sits on the ground with her pet dogs and
holds an umbrella, the question is [ Why is the woman
holding the umbrella? ]. Simply associating the
keyword [ umbrella ] with the word [ rain ] due to their
frequent co-occurrence in the pre-training corpus [7] will
lead to the wrong answer. AI models need to consider all vi-
sual clues presented, including the people, the pets, the sun-
shine, and the grass, to associate the keyword [ umbrella ]
in the question with the weather conditions and ongoing ac-
tivities to arrive at the answer [ for shade ]. This evi-
dence indicates that collecting as many visual clues as pos-
sible is necessary to achieve good results.
Based on the analysis above, we believe that collect-
ing visual clues of various instances in images will help
MLLM recognize the image more accurately, understand
the question better, recall relevant knowledge more easily,
and finally generate the reasoning results more intelligently.
To investigate this hypothesis, we design a novel VQA
framework called Q&A Prompts , which extracts numerous
question-answer pairs associated with different perspectives
in images as prompts for MLLMs to perform reasoning. For
each Q&A prompt, we choose an instance in the given im-
age as the answer and generate the related question to form
a question-answer pair. We generate the question-answer
prompts for almost every instance to get a bag of Q&A
prompts. The reason we choose question-answer pairs as
prompts comes from two folds: First, Q&A prompts can
focus on diverse instances in images like objects, scenes,
or actions, thereby offering multiple different perspectives
to understand the given image and the target question; Sec-
ond, the knowledge and reasoning insights hidden in these
question-answer pairs can help to explicitly uncover more
relevant world knowledge, which may be critical to bridg-
ing the logic gap between perception and reasoning when
answering the target question.
InQ&A Prompts , there are three key stages, which
are the visual question generation (VQG) model training
stage, the question-answer prompts generation stage, andthe visual-language reasoning stage. In the VQG model
training stage, we gather question-answer pairs in a VQA
training set to train a VQG model that can map an answer
together with the given image to a correlated question. Sub-
sequently, in the question-answer prompts generation stage,
we leverage a pre-trained image tagging model [19, 52] to
recognize various objects, scenes, and actions in images
with text tags. We employ these tags as answers and send
them into the VQG model along with the corresponding im-
ages to generate questions. Finally, in the visual-language
reasoning stage, we encode the generated question-answer
pairs with a visual-aware prompting module and send them
together with image and question features into a frozen
language model to reason out the answer. Since previous
VQA benchmark datasets [3, 12] have seen saturated per-
formance, we conduct experiments on the more challeng-
ing OK-VQA [34] and A-OKVQA [40] datasets, which are
newer and larger testbeds for MLLM to investigate their formance, we conduct experiments on the more challeng-
ing OK-VQA [34] and A-OKVQA [40] datasets, which are
newer and larger testbeds for MLLM to investigate their
abilities in accomplishing reasoning tasks requiring diverse
wrold knowledge. Experimental results show the gener-
atedQ&A Prompts improve the reasoning ability of MLLM,
such as BLIP-2 [24] and InstructBLIP [6], substantially.
In summary, we make the following key contributions:
• We propose a novel VQA framework that effectively gen-
erates and leverages question-answer pairs as prompts to
improve the reasoning ability of multi-modal large lan-
guage models. It provides a new perspective for the com-
munity to design VQA solutions by explicitly collecting
rich visual clues to bridge the logic gap between percep-
tion and reasoning when answering the target question.
• We design a novel question-answer prompts generation
scheme with a VQG model and an image tagging model,
which can generate Q&A prompts for all recognizable ob-
jects, scenes, and activities in images. Besides, we design
a new visual-aware prompting module to encode these
prompts efficiently for the subsequent reasoning process.
• We test the proposed method on the challenging OK-
VQA [34] and A-OKVQA [40] benchmarks, which study
reasoning over diverse forms of world knowledge, in-
cluding fact-based knowledge, commonsense knowledge,
physics knowledge, and visual knowledge. The proposed
Q&A Prompts achieves an accuracy of 68.1%and64.3%
on A-OKVQA [40] and OK-VQA [34], outperforming
previous methods by clear margins.

Multimodal Large Language Models. Multimodal Large

MLLMs typically achieve this by adapting frozen language
models to frozen image encoders with trainable connection

features into a language model with multiple cross-attention
blocks to perform visual language reasoning. LLaV A [28],
instead, directly projects visual features into the space of
text embeddings using a linear layer. BLIP-2 and Instruct-
BLIP [6, 24] introduce a more complex Q-Former to bridge
the gap between the embedding spaces of different modal-
ities. These cross-modality models align images and lan-
guage based on large-scale image-text pairs [5, 9, 25] and
conduct reasoning with language models. In this paper, we
mine more visual clues from images to generate numer-
ous question-answer pairs and send them into a multimodal
large language model as prompts. These prompts provide
rich visual information and uncover relevant world knowl-
edge, which is beneficial to reasoning out correct answers.
Visual Question Answering Requiring Reasoning over
Diverse World Knowledge. Different from classical VQA
tasks [3, 12, 46, 47], VQA tasks requiring reasoning
over world knowledge involve inferring intents, goals, the
physics of the world, and the social dynamics of individuals
from image inputs. More recently, the A-OKVQA [40] and
OK-VQA [34], which our work focuses on, present large-
scale challenging VQA datasets that encompass questions
requiring reasoning based on diverse world knowledge, in-
cluding visual knowledge, commonsense knowledge, and
factoid knowledge. Previous works like Img2LLM [14],
Prophet [41], and PromptCap [17] exploit the rich hidden
knowledge and strong reasoning abilities of large language
models (e.g., GPT3 [4]) to solve such problems. These
methods convert images into natural languages and con-
struct various prompt templates for large language models
with in-context learning [4] to generate answers. Anothergroup of works, such as KAT [13], REVIVE [27], and RE-
VEAL [18], directly encode questions and relevant knowl-
edge retrieved from external knowledge bases [4, 43, 45]
to train end-to-end models. Unlike these methods, we de-
sign a visual-question prompts generation scheme to mine
the information in images and unambiguous words to re-
duce confusion when answering the target questions. With
Q&A prompts, different types of world knowledge, such as
visual knowledge, fact-based knowledge, human behavior
knowledge, and physics knowledge, are incorporated into
the reasoning process to help infer the correct answers.

knowledge, and physics knowledge, are incorporated into
the reasoning process to help infer the correct answers.
3. Method
We apply the proposed method Q&A Prompts on the chal-
lenging A-OKVQA [40] and OKVQA [34], since they are
the most recent benchmarks that contain reasoning tasks
covering a wide range of world knowledge. Our Q&A
Prompts is a conceptually simple three-stage framework,
and Fig. 2 gives an overview of the proposed method.
Our pipeline contains three stages: a VQG model train-
ing stage, a question-answer prompts generation stage, and
a visual-language reasoning stage. Specifically, in the VQG
model training stage shown in Fig. 2 (a), we train a vanilla
MLLM with a broad range of image-answer pairs as input
and the corresponding question as the target output to learn
a mapping from answers to questions (detailed in Sec. 3.1).
In the prompts generation stage (shown in Fig. 2 (b)), we ex-
ploit an image tagging model [19, 52] to obtain relevant tags
including attributes, objects, actions, and scenes in images.
These tags serve as answers and will be fed into the VQG
model trained in the first stage to generate diverse questions containing rich visual clues and world knowledge (detailed
in Sec. 3.2). In the final reasoning stage shown in Fig. 2
(c), we utilize our proposed visual-aware prompting module
to encode these question-answer pairs into prompts, which
will be fed into the MLLM such as BLIP-2 [24] or Instruct-
BLIP [6] together with the image and the target question, to
make a prediction of the answer (detailed in Sec. 3.3). The
whole pipeline is flexible and effective in mining informa-
tive visual clues to correctly answer the given questions.
3.1. Stage-1: Train the VQG Model
Q&A Prompts requires a strong VQG model to produce
meaningful questions beneficial for reasoning. Given an
image Vand answer A, the VQG model is responsible for
posing an informative question Qwhich can be properly an-
swered by A. In order to explore as many visual clues in the
generated questions as possible for further reasoning, and
avoid generating general questions containing limited clues
(e.g., ”What is in this picture?”), we utilize the datasets of
A-OKVQA [40] or OK-VQA [34] as the training set Dfor
our VQG model, since the questions in their annotations are
diverse and specific, covering broader areas of knowledge
such as commonsense knowledge, visual knowledge, and
factoid knowledge. To create the VQG model that approx-
imates P(Q|V,A), we treat the problem of learning such
a model as a text-generation problem and wish to train the
MLLM (e.g., InstructBLIP [6]) as our VQG model with D
due to its strong image-language reasoning ability.
Specifically, as shown in Fig. 2 (a), the VQG model
comprises a frozen image encoder, a trainable alignment
module, and a frozen LLM. We extract image embeddings
Ev∈Rn×dvofVwith the image encoder ( nis the patch
number, dvis the embedding dimension), and then feed Ev
into the alignment module (a Qformer [24] here) to obtain
fixed-length visual features Fv∈Rk×dq, which will be sent
into the LLM together with the instruction. We write the in-
struction as the template containing the answer A, such as
”Given the image, generate a question whose answer is:
⟨A⟩. ”. The VQG model is trained using the cross-entropy
loss function with parameters θ:
LVQG =−LqX
t=1logP θ(Qt|Q<t,V,A) (1)
whereQtis predicted autoregressively at position t, andLq
is the sequence length of the ground truth question Q.
We emphasize the necessity of training the VQG model
to obtain the questions, instead of prompting a frozen
MLLM without training. We give examples in Fig. 3 (a).
Similar to the style of the questions in A-OKVQA (green),
the VQG model can propose more specific questions (blue)
with rich visual clues, instead of general questions with lim-

obtain the dense embedding vectors of each question and
show the distributions of T-SNE [44] embedding of them.
The questions generated by our VQG model are more di-
verse like questions in A-OKVQA, while the questions gen-
erated by MLLM without training are limited with low dif-
ferentiation, and our experiments will verify this.
3.2. Stage-2: Generate Question-Answer Prompts
Once the VQG model has been obtained, the generation of
question-answer pairs can proceed. In this stage, we will
explicitly generate a wide range of question-answer pairs
to help the model have a deeper and broader understanding question-answer pairs can proceed. In this stage, we will
explicitly generate a wide range of question-answer pairs
to help the model have a deeper and broader understanding
of the image before further reasoning. In order to gener-
ate diverse questions covering various perspectives of the
image, we should ensure the answers fed into the VQG
model are sufficient in varied forms. Therefore, we adopt
a strong image tagging model [19, 52] to produce rich tags
as answers. Different from object detectors that can only
recognize limited object labels, image tagging models aim
to identify various open-vocabulary elements in images, in-
cluding attributes, objects, actions, scenes, etc, which can
provide an appropriate source of the answers we need.
We utilize the RAM [52] model as our image tagging
model due to its superior recognition ability. As shown
in Fig. 2 (b), we feed the image Vinto the tagging model
and obtain various tags for each image. To make the tags
of each image more distinguishable, we remove the most
frequent ones containing general information, such as ’per-
son’, ’food’, ’man’, etc., resulting in an average of 14 tags
per image. We denote this set of tags as O={oi}M
i=1,
where Mis the number of tags associated with an image.
Using these tags as answers, we input them into the
trained VQG model along with the image, as shown in
Fig. 2 (b), to obtain corresponding questions that answer
these tags. To ensure that the generated questions (denoted
asT={ti}M
i=1) contribute effectively to answering the tar-
get question, we rank the generated questions T={ti}M
i=1 based on their similarity with the target question Q, and
adopt the questions with the Top-P similarities as the final
obtained question prompts U:
U={up}P
p=1= arg Top-P
ti∈T⟨T(ti),T(Q)⟩ (2)
where T(·)represents the sentence embedding model [39],
which encodes natural language into embedding vectors for
similarity computation. The ⟨·,·⟩operator is the inner prod-
uct, computing the cosine similarity between two sentences.
We then concatenate each uiinUand its corresponding oi
inOusing the template ”Question: ⟨ui⟩Answer: ⟨oi⟩”,
resulting in the final question-answer pairs as prompts S.
3.3. Stage-3: Reasoning with Q&A Prompts
After obtaining these question-answer pairs involving rich
visual clues and world knowledge, we use the proposed
visual-aware prompting module, as shown in Fig. 4, to en-
code these question-answer pairs into a set of prompt em-
beddings Fp∈Rk×dqfor our VQA model. We still uti-
lize the same MLLM (e.g., InstructBLIP [6]) as our VQA
model for the final reasoning. As in Fig. 2 (c), the encoded
prompt embeddings Fpwill be fed into the frozen LLM in
MLLM, together with the instruction embeddings and vi-
sual features Fvto predict the answer A:
A= LLM([ Fv;Fp; Embed(Ins)]) (3)
Here, Embed is the word embedding layer in LLM, the op-
erator [; ]means concatenation, and Insis the instruction
including the target question Q, represented as ”Question:
⟨Q⟩? Answer: ” . We then will introduce how the visual-
aware prompting module bootstrapped the reasoning ability
of the VQA model within our Q&A Prompts .
Prompt Encoder. The prompt encoder is responsible for
obtaining the semantics representations of the prompts S.
Specifically, we choose standard encoder-based language
models as our prompt encoder due to their strong ability in
language understanding. To preserve the well-trained rep-
resentations, we keep the parameters of the prompt encoder
frozen. We feed the prompts Sinto the prompt encoder and
get the encoded representations Fs∈RLs×dq, where Lsis
the sequence length of question-answer prompts and dqis
the hidden size of the prompt encoder.
Visual Gated Fusion. Since the output Fsfrom the prompt
encoder is an unimodal language representation, to fully
utilize the explicit information in images, the visual gated
fusion adaptively incorporates image information into this
representation with the visual embeddings Ev∈Rn×dv.
Specifically, shown in Fig. 4, we use a single-head atten-
tion mechanism, similar to MM-COT [53], to correlate the
language representation with the visual embeddings. We
define the query, key and value as Q=Fs∈RLs×dq,

in which WsandWvare learnable parameters. The gated
fusion allows the model to adaptively blend the information
from the language representation and visual embeddings,
resulting in the multimodal representations Fm.
Resampler Decoder. Although Fm∈RLs×dqin Eq. (5)
is the multimodal representations of S, we cannot directly
concatenate it with the visual features Fvand instruction
embeddings as in Eq. (3) due to the long sequence length
ofLs, which can result in extra memory and computational
burden, as well as the distraction to target question Q. In embeddings as in Eq. (3) due to the long sequence length
ofLs, which can result in extra memory and computational
burden, as well as the distraction to target question Q. In
light of this, we employ a lightweight resampler decoder in-
spired by Perceiver [20], to map Fm∈RLs×dqinto smaller-
sized prompt embeddings Fp∈Rk×dqwith fixed length k,
where k≪Ls(e.g., k= 32 andLs≥100).
Concretely, we additionally introduce the learnable em-
beddings Fp∈Rk×dqto interact with Fm. As shown in
Fig. 4, a cross-attention layer is applied by taking Fpas
query, and Fmas key and value, followed with a feed-
forward network, to generate prompt embeddings loaded
with the multimodal representations from Fm:
Fp= Cross-Attention( Fp,Fm) +Fp
Fp= FFN( Fp) +Fp,Fp= MLP( Fp)(6) where MLP projects dqtodlm(the hidden size of LLM).
At last, the final output of Fp∈Rk×dqwill be fed into
the LLM together with the question instruction embeddings
and visual features as in Eq. (3), to make predictions of an-
swers. The model is trained using the cross-entropy loss
function with trainable parameters θ:
LVQA =−LaX
t=1logP θ(At|A<t,V,Q,S) (7)
whereAtis predicted autoregressively at position t, andLa
is the sequence length of the ground truth answer text A.
4. Experiments
4.1. Dataset
We evaluate our Q&A Prompts on the challenging A-
OKVQA [40] and OK-VQA [34] since they are currently
the largest VQA datasets requiring complex reasoning over
diverse world knowledge. Specifically, the A-OKVQA
dataset consists of 24,903 samples, with 17.1k samples for
training, 1.1k for validation, and 6.7k for testing. The ques-
tions in this dataset require reasoning over various types
of world knowledge, such as commonsense knowledge,
factoid knowledge, and visual knowledge. The OK-VQA
dataset includes 14k questions covering a variety of knowl-
edge categories, with 9k samples for training, and 5k for
validation. Each sample in these two datasets includes an
image, a question, and 10 ground-truth answers. We use the
soft accuracy [3] as the standard evaluation metric.
4.2. Implementation Details
We use the InstructBLIP [6] as our default MLLM, to both
generate question-answer prompts and perform answer pre-
dictions. Besides, RAM [52] is utilized as the image tagging
model due to its strong recognition ability. To configure the
visual-aware prompting module, we use the text encoder in
CLIP [38] as our prompt encoder, and a value of 32 of the
kfor the number of prompt embeddings Fp∈Rk×dq, the
same as the number of visual tokens Fv∈Rk×dq. We train
the models using AdamW [30] as the optimizer with a learn-
ing rate of 2e−5and the strategy of mixed precision train-
ing. It is important to note that the parameters of the image
encoder, the large language model, and the prompt encoder
are kept frozen to maintain their pre-trained representations.
4.3. Main Results
Compariosn with SoTAs. The results in Tab. 1 demon-
strate the superiority of our proposed Q&A Prompts .
We have a significant improvement over existing SoTAs,
achieving an accuracy of 69.4% on the validation set and
68.1% on the test set in A-OKVQA, and an accuracy of
64.3% in OK-VQA. We also observe that Q&A Promptsachieves a greater improvement on A-OKVQA (+5.4% and
+6.0%) compared to OK-VQA (+2.2%). This can be ex-
plained that: different from questions in OK-VQA that
heavily rely on external knowledge, the questions in A-
OKVQA emphasize visually-grounded reasoning with a
comprehensive understanding of the image with diverse vi-
sual clues, rather than external knowledge retrieval. This
aligns with Q&A Prompts ’s philosophy, that is, instead of
relying on accessing any external knowledge base such as
Wikipedia [45], ConceptNet [43], or GPT3 [4], our focus
is on enhancing reasoning capabilities by discovering rich
visual clues hidden in the image and model.
Different baselines. To further validate the effectiveness
of our method, we conduct experiments to compare various
models, as shown in Tab. 2. These models differ mainly
in their large language models, and InstructBLIP models
have undergone instruction tuning based on the pre-trained
BLIP-2 models. The results show that using a stronger
baseline model leads to better performance, and our Q&A
Prompts method consistently improves performance on the
validation set of A-OKVQA by approximately 4.2% to
5.7%, demonstrating the effectiveness and generalizability
ofQ&A Prompts across different vision-language models.
Qualitative results. In Figure 5, we present qualitative
results to gain a clearer insight into our Q&A Prompts .
These cases demonstrate scenarios where correct an-
swers are only possible with our question-answer prompts.
For instance, the important clues provided by our Q&A These cases demonstrate scenarios where correct an-

Prompts of the [ mirror ], [constructor ], [cloudy ]
and [bible ], lead to the successful reasoning of correct
answers [ bathroom ], [visibility ], [raining ], and
[getting married ] respectively. This showcases the
valuable contribution of the question-answer prompts in
certain types of tasks, which can explicitly mine rich visual
clues and diverse world knowledge hidden in the image to
help the model reason out the correct answers.
4.4. Ablation Study
We investigate the role of question-answer prompts and the
visual-aware prompting module based on the InstructBLIP-
Vicuna-7B and the A-OKVQA dataset.
Different training sets for generated questions. We in-
vestigate how the VQG model will influence the perfor-
mance by directly prompting the MLLM without training,
or using different training sets to train our VQG model, in-
cluding the A-OKVQA, OK-VQA, and a mixture of them.
We report the Rouge-L score for the generated questions.
Results in Tab. 3 show that performance declines severely
when using Q&A prompts generated by MLLMs without
training. Besides, the best performance is only achieved
when the corresponding dataset is utilized as the training
set, and a mismatch or mixture of datasets could lead to a
slightly weaker performance. This could be attributed to the Method Image Representation Knowledge Source OK-VQA (%)A-OKVQA (%)

Strategies of fusing question-answer pairs. We explore
a simple approach where we directly prepend the question-
answer pairs as a natural language to the instruction with-
out our visual-aware prompting module ( VPM ). For com-
parison, we also replace the question-answer pairs with
image captions generated by BLIP-2 [24]. The results
in Tab. 4 show that the incorporation of question-answer
prompts is more effective than pure captions, and both di-
rectly prepending the question-answer pairs and using the
VPM can improve performance. Notably, the models with
VPM perform much better, which we attributed to its abil-
ity to combat some noise in the generated question-answer
pairs and avoid interference with the target question.
Different choices for the prompt encoder. We experi-
mented with various pre-trained language models (text en-
coder in CLIP [38], BERT [8], DeBERTa [16], RoBERTa
[29]) as the prompt encoder for question-answer prompts
S. The results, shown in Tab. 5, indicate that language mod-
els pre-trained by contrastive learning [38] with image-textpairs perform better than those pre-trained with text-only
corpus by masked language modeling [8]. This result is
consistent with previous findings [36, 42], which suggest
that models initialized with CLIP [38] are more suitable for
vision-language tasks due to their shared understanding of
the visual and textual content.
The number of the question-answer prompts. We also
study to figure out the effect of using different numbers of
question-answer pairs to construct the Q&A Prompts. The
results are displayed in Tab. 6. We denote the desired num-
ber as P. It can be observed that when Pis set to 8, the
model achieves optimal performance. We can deduce that
when Pis too large, it may introduce noisy pairs, while a
too small Pcan result in an ignorance of many essential and
informative question-answer pairs.
Components in visual-aware prompting module. We
validate the key components of our visual-aware prompt-
ing module in Tab. 7. We first study the effectiveness of
removing the visual gated fusion (w/o fusion), which in-
duces severe performance decline. Such performance drop
is expected, since the unimodal language representations
tend to involve ambiguity and bias. The additional incor-
poration of visual embeddings effectively allows for multi-
modal interaction beneficial for vision-language reasoning.
We also evaluate the importance of the resampler decoder
(w/o decoder), where we directly feed the long sequence
Fm∈RLs×dqinto the large language model in Eq. (3) and
also caused a performance drop. The sequence length of
target question Lqis×10times smaller than the sequence
length Lsof prompts S(Lq≤10,Ls≥100here), re-
sulting in a distraction to the understanding of the target target question Lqis×10times smaller than the sequence
length Lsof prompts S(Lq≤10,Ls≥100here), re-
sulting in a distraction to the understanding of the target
question. This highlights the importance of resampling
Fm∈RLs×dqinto a shorter Fp∈Rk×dq(k= 32 here).
5. Conclusions and Limitations
This paper has formally studied the problem of discover-
ing rich visual clues with question-answer prompts in VQA
tasks requiring reasoning over diverse world knowledge.
We introduce a novel framework, Q&A Prompts , which ef-
fectively generates a set of question-answer prompts and
encodes them with a visual-aware prompting module, sig-
nificantly boosting the reasoning ability of current vision-
language models. We conducted a series of experiments
on the A-OKVQA and OK-VQA benchmarks and achieved
significant results compared with previous methods. Ex-
tensive ablations and comprehensive analyses have demon-
strated the effectiveness and superiority of our method.
Limitations. While our method shows promising results,
it is essential to acknowledge the potential presence of
biases in the data as observed in previous VQA studies
[1, 7], as well as the lack of the ability for counting and
OCR. We plan to mitigate these biases and weaknesses to
enhance the reasoning ability of current models further. References

Prompts for VQA requiring Diverse World Knowledge
Supplementary Material
A. Overview of Supplementary Material
Our supplementary materials consist of additional analysis
and experimental results of the proposed method including:
• A detailed look into the tags and our generated questions
(detailed in Appendix B).
• More experimental results and analysis about our method
(detailed in Appendix C).
• More visualization (detailed in Appendix D).
B. Tags && Questions
B.1. Generated Tags
In this paper, we utilize the RAM [52] model to recog-
nize the tags as the answers we need for the VQG model,
since RAM can accurately identify 6400+ common tags in
total. Specifically, we generated an overall 359,584 tags
for 23,692 images in A-OKVQA, with 3,038 unique tags.
Notably, this statistics is computed after a filter from those
most frequent but general tags including: [ ’man’, ’person’,
’stand’, ’sit’, ’woman’, ’white’, ’catch’, ’table’, ’floor’,
’food’, ’road’, ’ride’, ’park’, ’walk’, ’building’, ’play’,
’green’, ’water’, ’red’, ’black’, ’yellow’, ’blue’ ]. We also
present a word cloud of the generated tags for images of
A-OKVQA in Fig. 6 to intuitively understand the tags.
B.2. Generated Questions
We randomly sample 250 questions from the questions gen-
erated by our VQG model for the A-OKVQA dataset and
annotate what kind of world knowledge was required to
answer the questions. The choices are the same with A-
OKVQA [40] including:
(1)Commonsense Knowledge [37, 50]: knowledge
about the world that humans learn from their everyday ex-
periences, including inferring the likely intents, social in-
teractions, procedure understanding, and future prediction.
For example, suits are often worn to formal events, and cer-
tain foods are associated with specific meals.
(2)Visual Knowledge [3, 12]: knowledge of concepts
represented visually or the spatial relationships in an image.
For example, the recognition of specific objects, animals,
and actions in the image.
(3)Knowledge Bases [34, 46, 47]: knowledge obtained
from textbooks, Wikipedia, and other textual sources. This
includes factoid and empirical knowledge such as knowing
the names of rare categories or the date of an event.
(4)Physical Knowledge [21, 40]: knowledge about the
physics of the world and processes that occur in it. An ex-

ample of such knowledge is that shaded areas are cooler
than unshaded areas in direct sunlight.
The distribution is shown Fig. 7. Most of the generated
questions focus on commonsense and visual knowledge,
as well as the A-OKVQA. We also present examples of
question-answer pairs with different knowledge types gen-
erated by our method in Fig. 8. It should be noted that
sometimes there is no clear distinction between these four
categories and a question may belong to either category.
C. More Experiments
In Sec. 4 and Tab. 4, we have made ablation studies to inves-
tigate the role of our generated Q&A pairs compared with Q: Where is the dog 
sitting?

pure captions, and the effectiveness of our VPM compared
with directly pretending captions or Q&A pairs as the natu-
ral language into the question instruction. Here, we make
additional ablation studies to figure out the relationships
between the generated tags and questions. As shown in
Tab. 8, when we directly prepend the tags or Q&A pairs into
the instruction, both the performances improve compared
with the vanilla model (+0.7% for tags, +2.6% for Q&A
prompts). Notably, when encoding the tags or Q&A pairs
into prompt embeddings with the VPM , a larger improve-
ment is observed for Q&A pairs (+5.4%) while a smaller
improvement for tags (+0.3%).
We attribute this performance difference to the involved
information and sequence length of the generated tags and
Q&A pairs. For one thing, the Q&A pairs contain more vi-
sual clues and world knowledge compared to simple tags.
This is intuitively understandable because the question it-
self can contain a large amount of information that is help-
ful for the target question (e.g., compared with a simple tag
[’sea’ ], the Q&A pairs [ ’Q: What body of water is the kite
flying above? A: sea’ ] conveys more information about the
surroundings of the environment). This is why our Q&A
pairs work better than simple tags or captions whenever di-
rectly prepending or using VPM . For another, despite the
Q&A pairs including more information, it has a longer se-
quence length than the tags. Therefore, it’s essential to com-
press the much longer Q&A pairs into short representationsFusion strategy Accuracy (%)

with our VPM to avoid interference with the target ques-
tion when feeding it into the MLLM. Instead, the sequence
length of tags is much shorter, additional compression will
destroy the existing semantic information in tags, and a di-
rect prepending into the instruction is enough. That’s why
VPM works well for the long Q&A pairs while less effec-
tive for the short tags.
D. More Visualizations
Finally, we show more visualization cases in Fig. 9 and
Fig. 10 to illustrate how the Q&A Prompts works. The
results show that the generated question-answer pairs are
helpful for MLLM to generate correct answers. Question:
